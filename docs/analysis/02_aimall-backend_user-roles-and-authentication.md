## User Roles

### Customer
Customers are end-users who engage in shopping, product exploration, and utilize personalized AI-driven recommendations. 

**Key Scenarios:**
- Browsing as guest, registering as member, or signing in with external providers (e.g., Google, Kakao).
- Adding products to cart, placing orders, writing reviews, modifying profiles.
- Interacting with AI features like recommendations, preference analytics.

**Permission Boundaries:**
- Customers SHALL only access their own orders, profiles, and carts.
- Customers SHALL NOT alter data of other users.
- WHEN authenticated, THE system SHALL expose all customer features; WHEN not authenticated, THE system SHALL restrict access to account-related actions.

### Seller
Sellers are registered business entities managing product listings, inventory, and promotional campaigns.

**Key Scenarios:**
- Registering a seller account and verifying business credentials.
- Listing new products, editing inventories, viewing analytics, responding to customer inquiries.
- Utilizing AI sales/stock analysis.

**Permission Boundaries:**
- Sellers SHALL only manage their own product listings, inventory, and orders.
- IF a seller attempts to access another seller’s data, THEN THE system SHALL deny access and log the event.
- Sellers SHALL have elevated privileges over customers but no system-wide controls.

### Administrator
Administrators manage the platform, users, and configuration.

**Key Scenarios:**
- Approving seller applications, reviewing flagged content, updating system settings.
- Monitoring analytics, managing AI models, resolving escalated support tickets.

**Permission Boundaries:**
- Admins SHALL perform actions according to assigned hierarchical permissions. E.g., super-admins may manage all resources, support-admins are scoped to customer care.
- IF an admin without privilege attempts a restricted action, THEN THE system SHALL block it and trigger an audit log.

## Authentication & Identity Management

Authentication uses API-driven workflows with support for email/password, external OAuth providers, and persistent sessions.

**Registration (Typical)**:
```
sequenceDiagram
User->>System: Submit registration details
System->>DB: Save user
System-->>User: Confirmation/Token
```
- WHEN registration completes, THE system SHALL create a user record and issue a verification token.

**Account Linking (OAuth):**
- Customers or Sellers may link accounts to third-party providers for seamless login.
- WHEN linking, THE system SHALL verify provider tokens and associate identities.

**Token Lifecycle:**
- THE system SHALL issue JWT tokens on successful authentication.
- WHILE token is valid, THE system SHALL allow resource access per role.
- IF refresh token is expired or revoked, THEN THE system SHALL require re-authentication.
- IF token misuse/replay is detected, THEN THE system SHALL immediately revoke all active tokens for the user.

---

## Session & Token Handling

- Sessions use signed JWT and refresh tokens.
- IF a token is tampered or invalid, THEN THE system SHALL block access and log the incident.
- WHEN multiple invalid attempts occur, THE system SHALL introduce exponential back-off or temporary lockout.

**Security Strategies:**
- Replay attack prevention is enforced via nonces and token claims.
- Session expiration uses short-lived access tokens and securely stored refresh tokens.
- All sensitive flows SHALL occur over HTTPS with HSTS enabled.

**Error Scenarios:**
- IF a session expires, THEN THE system SHALL redirect user to login and display a context-appropriate message.
- IF mismatched tokens or invalid session flows arise, THEN THE system SHALL invalidate all related tokens.

---

## Access Control & Authorization

- THE system SHALL enforce role-based and resource-based permissions via ABAC.
- WHEN a role escalation is attempted, THE system SHALL perform multi-step checks with admin approval.
- IF any request conflicts with assigned permissions, THEN THE system SHALL deny the action, record an audit event, and notify system operations where applicable.

**Real-World Example:**
- IF a seller tries to change platform-wide settings, THEN THE system SHALL block the request and create a high-severity audit log entry.
- IF a customer attempts direct API access to admin endpoints, THEN THE system SHALL deny and log with alert priority.

---

## Non-Functional & Security Requirements

- THE system SHALL log all authentication events, errors, and significant permission changes.
- THE system SHALL implement MFA as an optional feature for sellers and administrators.
- Audit log schema SHALL include: timestamp, user ID, event type, IP, and outcome.
- WHERE suspicious activity thresholds are met, THE system SHALL trigger alerts and automated monitoring workflows.
- Rationales: Strong logging and clear audit trails ensure traceability, support regulatory compliance, and enhance incident response.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- All user role scenarios are implemented per described permissions; validated via role-based testing (success/failure for all CRUD operations).
- Authentication and session flows are verifiable through security tests: token issuance, revocation, refresh, and abuse detection coverage.
- EARS-formatted requirements are testable and traceable—checked via structured requirements review.
- All security requirements are evidenced by presence in system logs and monitoring dashboards.
- Failed criteria is defined as any deviation in role boundary, unlogged privilege escalation, or incomplete token/session management per described flows.

# 06. Promotions & Balances

## 1. Overview
Promotions & Balances empower retailers to drive customer engagement and retention via rule-driven incentives. This module offers flexible coupon systems, deposit/mileage reward programs, layered eligibility, and advanced administrative controls. AI-powered analytics, auditability, and compliance are prioritized for large-scale, omnichannel operations.

## 2. Coupon System Design
### 2.1 Coupon Types
- **Public:** Available to all users/segments, linked to events or campaigns
- **Private:** Targeted, distributed per user or segment (via notification/email/SMS)
- **Code-based:** Redeemable by unique or reuseable codes, valid for limited time, campaign or social sharing
### 2.2 Coupon Rule Engine
- Define stacking rules, min/max spend, excluded products/categories, validity periods
- Dynamic eligibility via AI: segment users by behavior, churn risk, region, or LTV
- Multichannel support: coupons scoped per store/site, optionally cross-channel
### 2.3 Distribution & Redemption Workflow
- Admin: Create/distribute via dashboard, API, or automation
- Customer: Claim from dashboard, redeem at checkout, view usage history
- Audit logs for assignment, usage, expiration, and code leak monitoring
### 2.4 Fraud Detection (AI/ML)
- Machine learning to flag abnormal redemption (high frequency, bot usage, geographical anomalies)
- Models using IP/device fingerprint, behavioral patterns, and coupon sharing/leakage
- Automated rules: block suspicious accounts, notify admins with explainable output
### 2.5 Success Metrics
- Redemption rate, incremental sales per campaign
- Churn reduction vs. control group
- Fraud/abuse rates and cost avoidance value

## 3. Deposit & Mileage Subsystem
### 3.1 User Balances
- Maintain segmented balances (cash deposit, promotional mileage/points, refunds)
- Audit trail for all changes; soft delete for adjustment reversals
- Support for gift balances and loyalty tiers
### 3.2 Earning & Redemption
- Mileage: Earned on qualifying purchases, engagement (e.g., reviews), or referrals
- Deposits: Loaded by customer/admin, refundable or donatable
- Admin configuration for earn/redeem rates, caps, promotional multipliers
### 3.3 Refunds & Withdrawals
- Customers can request partial/full balance withdrawals subject to workflow/rules
- Refund preference logicâ€”deposit vs. card/original payment, legal compliance (AML/PCI-DSS)
- Documented refund status, audit logs per transaction
### 3.4 Success Criteria
- Engagement uplift (usage, NPS boost)
- Reduced cost of handling refunds
- Mileage breakage and loyalty impact tracking

## 4. Administrative Controls & Compliance
### 4.1 Dashboard Features
- Listings: All coupons, balances, redemption logs, abuse flags
- Bulk grant/revoke, advanced filters, real-time alerts for large redemptions
- Exports: CSV/PDF, business/finance integrations (ERP/CRM)
### 4.2 Compliance & Auditability
- Regulatory rules for coupon/point expiration, notification (GDPR, PCI)
- Immutable logs for all balance/coupon actions, tying changes to responsible users
- Configurable data retention period, automated legal/finance reports

## 5. API & Integration Requirements
- Secure endpoints for distributing, claiming, and redeeming coupons/balances
- Channel/context scoping per API
- Webhooks for 3rd-party systems (marketing, BI, loyalty partners)
- Backward compatible versioning and audit exports

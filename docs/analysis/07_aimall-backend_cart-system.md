# Cart System – AIMall Backend

## 1. Overview
The cart system is a core backend component enabling customers to select, store, and manage their desired products prior to purchase. It bridges the pre-checkout experience, facilitates seamless order creation, and leverages AI mechanisms to recover abandoned carts, improving conversion rates. 

## 2. Objectives
- Ensure reliable and intuitive cart management for all authenticated customer sessions.
- Accelerate conversion rates through AI-driven reminders and recommendations.
- Provide sellers and administrators visibility into cart trends for inventory and promotion strategies.

## 3. Cart Mechanics
- **Ubiquitous**: THE cart system SHALL support both authenticated and guest users, linking carts to sessions or user accounts as appropriate.
- **Event-driven**: WHEN a customer adds a product, THE cart system SHALL create a cart (if not existing) and attach the product as a cart item with quantity and selected options.
- **Event-driven**: WHEN a customer logs in after using a guest cart, THE cart system SHALL merge the guest and member cart into one persistent account-linked cart.
- **Ubiquitous**: THE cart system SHALL allow customers to update, remove, or adjust quantities and options of items within their cart.
- **Ubiquitous**: THE cart system SHALL maintain data consistency during concurrent cart modifications.

## 4. Cart Item Structure
- **Each cart item SHALL include:**
  - Product reference (ID, name, thumbnail)
  - Quantity (positive integer, with min/max limits per product policy)
  - Product options/variants (e.g., size, color)
  - Pricing snapshot (unit price, applied discount)

- **Unwanted Behavior**: IF an item is out of stock or unavailable at update time, THEN THE cart system SHALL flag and highlight the item to the customer and prevent checkout until resolved.

## 5. AI-Driven Abandoned Cart Recovery
- **State-driven**: WHILE a cart remains inactive for a predefined period, THE system SHALL trigger an AI algorithm to:
  - Analyze abandonment reason (e.g., price, availability)
  - Generate personalized notifications or promotions to persuade completion
  - Suggest alternative products if carted items are unavailable
- **Event-driven**: WHEN a user completes the checkout, THE system SHALL archive the cart and clear its items.

## 6. Cart-to-Order Conversion
- **Event-driven**: WHEN a customer initiates checkout, THE cart system SHALL validate all items (stock, price, eligibility) and lock them to prevent race conditions.
- **Ubiquitous**: THE cart system SHALL generate an order from the validated cart items, handing over control to the order and delivery module for fulfillment.

## 7. Role-Specific Permissions
- **Customer**: Add, view, update, and remove cart items; receive AI-based reminders; proceed to checkout.
- **Seller**: View anonymized aggregated cart data and abandoned cart analytics for their inventory.
- **Administrator**: Access full cart analytics, set abandoned cart recovery policies, and monitor system health.

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: THE cart system SHALL handle up to 10,000 simultaneous cart sessions with sub-second response times.
- **Security**: THE system SHALL encrypt sensitive session and product data in transit and at rest.
- **Compliance**: THE system SHALL adhere to platform privacy policies and regulatory guidelines in processing cart data.

## 9. Acceptance Criteria
- Customers can add, remove, and update items in real-time with immediate feedback.
- Abandoned cart recovery rates increase by 20% over baseline via AI-driven interventions.
- Zero data races or inconsistencies during high-concurrency events.
- Carts merge seamlessly on guest→member conversion.

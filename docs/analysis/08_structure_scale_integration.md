# Structure, Scale & Integration

## Overview
This section details how the backend architecture of the AI Shopping Mall system achieves scalability, flexible structure management, secure and efficient integrations, and future-readiness. Capabilities include dynamic channel/section/category modifications, robust attachment handling, modular external integrations, and scalable storage strategies.

## Objectives
- Support seamless growth in channels, sections, and categories
- Ensure stable performance at scale with efficient data structures and storage strategies
- Enable open integrations with external systems (APIs, payments, logistics)
- Guarantee secure, compliant asset management and delivery
- Maintain backward compatibility and system upgradability

## Dynamic Structure Management
- **Channels, Sections, Categories:** Admins can create, modify, or remove these without downtime. Each structure is versioned for audit and rollback.
- **Hierarchy Flexibility:** Categories can be deeply nested per channel; supports channel-specific merchandising logic.
- **Role-based Access:** Only authorized roles can alter structures, with all actions logged.

## Secure & Versioned Attachments
- **Attachment System:** Supports product images, banners, user uploads; all objects versioned with immutable references. 
- **CDN Integration:** Assets are delivered via globally-distributed CDNs for performance and uptime.
- **Security & Audit:** Attachments are linked via signed URLs, expiring tokens, access verified per user/session.
- **Storage Backends:** Pluggable with object storage (AWS S3, Azure Blob, etc.); all storage access events are logged for compliance.

## Open API, Plug-ins & Integration
- **API Standards:** REST (OpenAPI) and GraphQL endpoints; full read/write coverage for external extensions. Versioning for all APIs.
- **Plug-in Modules:** External login, payment, logistics, and AI can be added without codebase changes. Dynamic registration and upgradeability.
- **Authentication:** OAuth2, SSO, API key management for secure partner and in-house integration.

## Scalability & Data Strategies
- **Strategic Denormalization:** Applied for high-throughput domains (order, product search) to optimize reads, balancing with consistency via snapshot/versioning.
- **Sharding & Partitioning:** Native support for database horizontal scaling as data grows (per channel, large tenants, etc.).
- **Caching:** Built-in distributed cache layer for hot paths (catalog, pricing, inventory) configurable by channel.

## API Versioning & Compatibility
- **Full Versioning:** Every endpoint provides backward-compatible releases to prevent integration breakage.
- **Deprecation & Transition:** Old versions maintained with automated migration notes and gradual sunset protocols.

## Acceptance Criteria
| No. | Requirement                      | Success Criteria                                 |
|-----|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Dynamic structure modification    | Changes without downtime, reflected in UI within 1 min |
| 2   | Secure, versioned attachments     | All attachments retrievable by snapshot/version, tracked access logs |
| 3   | Modular external integrations     | Plug-ins registered/unregistered at runtime with zero downtime |
| 4   | Scalable storage & sharding       | Proven scaling via load tests & tenant isolation     |
| 5   | API versioning & backward compat. | Multiple API versions can coexist, with migration support |

### High-level Scaling Logic
- Channels, sections, categories: partitioned tables per channel
- Order/product/balance: elastic sharding based on business unit or data volume
- APIs: versioned, with migration docs and backward-compatibility wrappers

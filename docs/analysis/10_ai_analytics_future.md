# 10. AI/ML, Analytics & Future-readiness

## Overview
This section details the requirements and strategies for integrating AI, machine learning (ML), advanced analytics, and future extensibility into the e-commerce backend. Focus is placed on flexibility, compliance, explainability, and robust support for evolving business needs.

## Objectives
- Harness AI/ML for product recommendations, fraud detection, dynamic search, and adaptive pricing.
- Deliver actionable, real-time analytics for sales, lifetime value (LTV), user segmentation, funnels, and operational dashboards.
- Ensure compliance, explainability, and full auditability for all AI-driven processes.
- Maintain a modular, extensible foundation for omnichannel support and future integrations.

## Functional Requirements
### AI Capabilities
- **Recommendation Engine**: Provide context-aware, personalized product recommendations via an AI API, configurable per channel, role, and merchandising rules.
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Support real-time price optimization based on demand, inventory, competitive analysis, and customer behavior patterns.
- **Fraud Detection**: AI/ML-powered transactional risk scoring, anomaly detection, and rule-based fraud prevention, with continuous learning and audit logging.
- **AI-Enhanced Search**: Support semantic, synonyms-based, and context-enriched search.[AI API integration]
- **Explainable AI**: Export interpretable rationale for key ML-driven outcomes (e.g., rejection reasons in fraud reviews, logic for recommendations/pricing).

### Analytics
- **Dashboards**: Role-specific access to sales, LTV, funnel, and segmentation metrics. Customizable, real-time visualization, with export (CSV, JSON, PDF).
- **Real-time Segmentation**: On-demand building of dynamic customer segments, behavior-triggered alerts, and campaign integration hooks.
- **Omnichannel Insights**: Cross-channel funnel visualization, sales attribution, user journey tracing, and cohort-level analytics.
- **Auditability**: Immutably log all access, changes, and outputs related to analytics and ML modules for compliance and troubleshooting.

### Architecture & Extensibility
- **Modular AI Hooks**: Plug-in structure for swapping AI/ML providers, custom model deployment, and per-channel AI logic tuning.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Versioned APIs and model pipelines to prevent operational disruptions during upgrades.
- **Integration-ready**: Support for seamless addition of new AI, analytics, and business logic modules (e.g., NPS, retention scoring, social signal analysis).

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: <250ms latency target for AI recommendations and real-time analytics endpoints.
- **Compliance & Data Privacy**: Processes must meet GDPR, CCPA, PCI-DSS, AML, and regional regulations with field-level security and data retention logic.
- **Explainability**: Every automated decision must be traceable; support exports for external compliance review.
- **High Availability & Scalability**: The architecture must support bursts in analytics/AI demand with graceful degradation and alerting.

## User Personas & Scenarios
| Persona      | Scenario                                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Admin        | Audit ML decisions behind flagged transactions    |
| Seller       | View AI-powered product insights and market trends|
| Customer     | Receive dynamic, relevant suggestions in real time|
| Data Analyst | Build custom reports, export analytics, review attribution logs |

## Roadmap & Future Considerations
- Expansion to additional ML-driven services (automated content moderation, logistics optimization, customer support bots).
- Ongoing monitoring and upgrading of models based on business outcomes and feedback.
- Exploration of multi-modal AI (text, vision, audio) to further enrich user experiences.

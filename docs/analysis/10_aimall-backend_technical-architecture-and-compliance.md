# Technical Architecture and Compliance

## 1. System Architecture

### Modular Microservices
The platform shall employ a modular microservices architecture, with each microservice responsible for a well-defined domain boundary:
- **User Service**: Manages registration, authentication, and user profiles. THE user service SHALL ensure user state consistency across sessions. IF user data update fails, THEN THE user service SHALL perform rollback and alert the admin.
- **Product Service**: Handles CRUD operations for products, including inventory and pricing. WHEN a seller modifies product details, THE product service SHALL validate data against business rules.
- **Order Service**: Facilitates cart checkout, order placement, and payment integration. WHEN order placement succeeds, THE order service SHALL trigger delivery scheduling via API.
- **Community Service**: Manages bulletin boards, reviews, and user-to-user interaction.
- **Analytics Service**: Aggregates logs, user behavior events, and performance metrics.
Services interact via secured REST/gRPC APIs orchestrated by the API Gateway. Each service SHALL isolate its datastore, and communicates via event queues for eventual consistency.

### API Gateway Pattern
THE API Gateway SHALL centralize external and internal API calls. THE system SHALL route incoming requests based on role (guest, member, seller, admin), applying JWT-based authentication and RBAC for endpoints. WHEN a request fails authentication, THE gateway SHALL return HTTP 401 and log ACCESS_DENIED. IF a seller submits an out-of-scope operation, THEN THE gateway SHALL reject the call with HTTP 403.
Failed downstream requests SHALL return descriptive error messages for observability. THE gateway SHALL implement circuit breaker logic for repeated failures, and SHALL degrade gracefully to ensure partial functionality for most users.

### High Availability
THE platform architecture SHALL enforce statelessness for horizontal scaling. Services SHALL be deployed across multiple availability zones and regions. WHEN instance health check fails, THE orchestrator SHALL trigger automatic replacement. IF regional failure is detected, THEN THE load balancer SHALL fail over to healthy regions, ensuring zero-downtime for critical operations. Scaling policies SHALL be driven by threshold metrics (e.g., CPU > 70% triggers scale-out). State synchronization (e.g., in-flight carts or sessions) SHALL utilize distributed cache with fallback persistence.

### Data Security and Isolation
THE system SHALL implement logical multi-tenancy: all user, seller, and admin data SHALL be partitioned and scope-enforced at the datastore and API layers. WHERE sensitive personal data exists, THE system SHALL apply AES-256 encryption-at-rest and TLS-in-transit. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted, THE system SHALL deny with error, log activity, and notify the security officer. Exception handling SHALL employ rule-based masking for sensitive fields in logs.

## 2. Regulatory / Compliance Design

### Data Privacy (GDPR, CCPA, PIPA)
THE system SHALL provide workflows for data subject requests: WHEN a user requests data access, correction, or deletion, THE system SHALL process the request within legal timeframes, log actions, and confirm with the user. Consent capture SHALL be explicit at account creation. Data flow diagrams SHALL document where data is stored, processed, and transferred across regions. THE system SHALL pseudonymize or anonymize exported datasets for analytics. IF a user withdraws consent, THEN THE system SHALL revoke all non-essential data processing.

### Audit Logging & Consent Management
THE platform SHALL retain audit logs for a minimum of 5 years. WHERE PII is present, logs SHALL be encrypted and, after the retention period, automatically anonymized or deleted. Audit logs SHALL record all admin actions, data changes, and user consent events. WHEN a data breach is detected, THE system SHALL flag affected entries, alert administrators, and support notification workflows per law.

### Security Certifications
THE system SHALL be continuously monitored to enforce compliance checkpoints: security training for admins, secure SDLC processes, and annual penetration testing SHALL be documented. Logs from audits and certifications SHALL be stored in an immutable format. WHEN a compliance audit is due, THE compliance module SHALL export required documentation and evidence of controls to auditors.

## 3. AI/ML Integration

### AI Personalization & Insights
THE AI modules SHALL use per-user purchase history and behavioral data to deliver recommendations. THE model inference service SHALL log all recommendation events, providing an audit trail. WHERE Explainable AI (XAI) is enabled, THE system SHALL offer feature attribution details (e.g., “Recommended due to previous search for ‘smartphones’”). Admins SHALL be able to review AI-driven decisions for fairness, and rollback or retrain models as needed.

### Data Governance
THE data governance system SHALL track all dataset versions and transformations using lineage records. WHERE data anomalies are detected, THE system SHALL auto-flag, trigger approval flows, and allow rollback to previous data snapshots.

## 4. Analytics & Monitoring

THE analytics module SHALL consolidate platform KPIs (DAU, order conversion, churn rate) on real-time dashboards. WHEN critical error rates exceed threshold, THE system SHALL trigger alerts to on-call engineers. Sample incident: IF payment failure rate > 2% in 5 mins, THEN THE system SHALL escalate to L2 support and annotate incident timeline. Event logs SHALL be queryable for root-cause analysis. All system metrics SHALL be exportable in standard formats for BI tools.

## 5. Extensibility & Future-Proofing

THE platform SHALL adopt versioned APIs and modular plugin architecture. WHEN a new feature is onboarded, THE core SHALL expose feature toggles and interface versioning to prevent breaking changes. WHERE backward compatibility is broken, THE gateway SHALL route legacy clients to fallback modules. The extension framework SHALL allow dynamic onboarding of new AI/ML modules, payment providers, or analytics dashboards without downtime.

# 11. Accessibility & Localization

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the accessibility and localization requirements for the AI Shopping Mall Backend System. The goal is to ensure the platform is usable, compliant, and inclusive for diverse global audiences, spanning various languages, locales, and accessibility needs.

## 2. Objectives
- Guarantee compliance with global accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA or higher)
- Ensure full internationalization (i18n) including support for right-to-left (RTL) languages
- Provide mechanisms for region-specific formatting (currency, number, date/time)
- Automate and simplify localization workflows for developers and content teams

## 3. Accessibility Requirements
### 3.1 Legal & Standards Compliance
- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA conformance as baseline
- Automated and manual accessibility testing integrated into release pipelines
- Accessibility statement generation for each channel

### 3.2 Usability Support
- Keyboard navigability and ARIA roles throughout all admin/member/seller UIs
- Screen reader compatibility for dynamic and static content
- Adjustable UI scaling, font sizes, and color/contrast settings
- Accessible forms: clear error messaging, field context, logical tab order
- Alt-text for all media assets (auto-generation support via AI where possible)

## 4. Localization (i18n/l10n) Features
### 4.1 Internationalization Engine
- Multi-language UX for all user-facing apps and admin tools
- Locale-sensitive number, date, and currency formatting
- Language switcher UI component with deep-linking per session
- RTL language support (Arabic, Hebrew), including mirrored layouts

### 4.2 Automated Localization Management
- Integration with automated translation management systems/APIs
- Workflows for source string extraction, translation, review, and versioning
- Support for pseudo-localization and visual QA previews per locale
- Real-time deployment of localization updates with rollback capability

### 4.3 Regional Compliance
- Flexible formatting modes for pricing, taxes, and local regulatory requirements
- Integration of regional address/postal code validation modules
- Dynamic content adaptation (e.g., holidays, legal notices) per target region

## 5. Acceptance Criteria
| Area | Criteria |
|------|---------|
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.1 AA passes for all channels; UIs testable by screen reader, keyboard-only, and color-blind users |
| Localization | Minimum 10 languages with RTL support; real-time locale switching; 100% string coverage |
| Formats | Automatic currency/date/number format detection by locale |
| Automation | 95% reduction in manual steps for l10n deployment |

/**
 * Retrieve shipments (fulfillment events) for an order from

 *
 * Retrieve all shipment records linked to a specific order. This operation
 * provides full delivery history and logistics tracking for both customers and
 * sellers. It queries the aimall_backend_shipments table, presenting structured
 * details such as carrier, tracking number, shipment status, and
 * shipping/delivery times.
 *
 * User access is enforced: only the customer who placed the order, the seller
 * fulfilling it, or an administrator may view shipment data, to protect
 * logistics privacy and compliance requirements. The endpoint is primarily used
 * for customer notifications, seller logistics dashboards, and admin audit
 * purposes.

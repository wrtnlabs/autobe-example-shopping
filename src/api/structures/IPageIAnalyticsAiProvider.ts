/**
 * A paged result of AI provider records as required in analytics/AI provider
 * registry UIs and API requests.
 *
 * Implements the standard IPage<T> pattern from requirements: includes
 * `pagination` for meta (current, limit, records, pages) and `data` array of
 * IAnalyticsAiProvider entities. Used across all paged API list/search
 * endpoints.
 *
 * Based on the core IPage<T> design; all fields and structure are derived from
 * the standardized pagination container enforced platform-wide for list/search
 * operations.

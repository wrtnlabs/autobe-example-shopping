/**
 * IPageIProductSeoMeta is the paginated container for product SEO meta records
 * as defined in the product_seo_metas table.
 *
 * This type enables fetching and presenting pages of SEO metadata for product
 * listings, SEO dashboard views, and management interfaces. It follows the
 * standard pagination model IPage in the schemaâ€”supporting efficient queries
 * over large sets and delivery of SEO meta details in a scalable way. The
 * pagination property delivers details like current page, item limits, and
 * total record counts. The data property contains an array of IProductSeoMeta
 * items, providing the atomic metadata for each product/channel pair as defined
 * in the schema (meta_title, meta_description, meta_keywords, and
 * product/channel references, etc.).
 *
 * The IPageIProductSeoMeta and related types provide robust support for
 * auditability, compliance reporting, and SEO intelligence as demanded by
 * business requirements for e-commerce and search-optimized platforms.

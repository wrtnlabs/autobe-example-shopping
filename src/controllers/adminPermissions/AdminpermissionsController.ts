   * Successful creation is audit-logged. Assignment to roles/admins is
   * handled separately. Attempts to create duplicate permission codes or

   * endpoint is part of the full RBAC admin API set.
   *
   * All new permissions become immediately available for assignment to admin
   * roles in related endpoints.

   * This API operation retrieves a searchable, paginated list of admin

   * controls (page, size). The operation supports RBAC checks ensuring only
   * entitled admin users can view permission definitions.
   *
   * Returned data includes code, name, description, and any auxiliary
   * metadata. This endpoint works with POST/GET/PUT/DELETE /adminPermissions
   * endpoints to enable full RBAC assignment, permission review, and
   * compliance audits. No permissions are modified by use of this endpoint.

   * Create a new adminRole (admin_roles table).

   * entries in the 'admin_roles' table. Typical fields in the request are
   * code (unique per role), name (for UI and search), and an optional
   * description (for help and documentation purposes).
   *
   * Creation is permission-controlled (RBACâ€”typically superadmin or
   * admin-action-manage roles). On successful creation, returns the complete
   * admin role record. Attempts to create duplicate codes or names result in
   * a unique constraint error.
   *
   * Every creation is logged via admin_action_logs, supporting full
   * compliance and auditability. Used together with GET/PUT/DELETE
   * /adminRoles endpoints for RBAC lifecycle management.
   *
   * @param body Admin role creation payload.

  /**
   * List/search adminRoles (admin_roles table), paginated.
   *
   * This API operation allows listing, searching, and paginating all admin
   * role definitions from the 'admin_roles' table. Admin roles determine the
   * permissions and actions available to administrative staff and are central
   * to the RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) engine.
   *
   * Supported query parameters include search by role code or name, sorting
   * by creation date or name, and pagination controls (page/size). Role
   * definitions are critical for configuration and permission management as
   * outlined in the database schema and the User Architecture section,
   * especially for emergency escalation or review of role assignments.
   *
   * Access to the list is controlled by admin RBAC. If no roles are found,
   * returns an empty array; otherwise, paginates according to the request.
   *
   * Related endpoints: POST /adminRoles (create), GET/PUT/DELETE
   * /adminRoles/{id} (single role management).
   *
   * @param body Admin roles list retrieval, with optional search/pagination
   *   filters.

   * Create new admin identity (admins table, onboarding).

   * may include additional onboarding details as the schema evolves. Business
   * logic: Ensures no duplicate admin for same user, ties in with RBAC
   * assignment logic (see admin_assignments), and issues onboarding audit
   * log. Hard errors returned for duplicate/validation error; only superadmin
   * or equivalent may onboard new admins. The newly created admin is
   * returned, with audit fields populated. This operation is core to staff
   * onboarding, permission matrix management, and compliance traceability
   * throughout the platform.
   *
   * @param body New admin creation request, with user_id and status (pending,
   *   active, etc).

  /**
   * Update an admin record (admins table).
   *
   * This API operation allows system administrators to update an existing
   * admin account's information in the 'admins' table. The primary use case
   * includes adjusting admin status (such as activating, suspending, or
   * updating admin profile fields) or changing the associated user identity.
   *
   * Security and permission considerations: Only super-admin or appropriately
   * permissioned roles can invoke this operation, as changes to admins
   * represent sensitive system modifications. Extensive logging and auditing
   * are enforced. Before updating, the system validates whether the admin
   * exists and checks for unique constraints on the user_id relationship,
   * ensuring that only valid and active users are linked to admin records.
   *
   * On update, all relevant audit logs are updated via the
   * 'admin_action_logs' for compliance. The operation returns the complete,
   * updated admin record.
   *
   * Should be used in conjunction with GET/PUT/DELETE on /admins endpoints
   * for full admin lifecycle management. Error handling includes unique
   * constraint violations, non-existent IDs, and forbidden states.
   *
   * This operation adheres to the requirements in the 'User Architecture'
   * document regarding escalation, rollback, RBAC updates, and auditability.
   *
   * @param id Target admin's ID
   * @param body Admin update body. Includes fields like status, and
   *   optionally updated user linkage.

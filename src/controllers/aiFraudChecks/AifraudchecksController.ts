  /**
   * Update an AI fraud check record by id (ai_fraud_checks table).
   *
   * This API endpoint allows authorized staff or designated compliance
   * systems to update an existing AI fraud check record in the
   * ai_fraud_checks database table. The operation is performed on a single
   * fraud check instance identified by its unique UUID.
   *
   * The endpoint supports updating specific fields related to the fraud check
   * such as score, decision, human-read explanation, or reason for model
   * score adjustment. All changes must be strictly logged and adhere to
   * immutable audit log practicesâ€”older values are retained in the audit
   * system for compliance and risk management. Soft update is enforced: the
   * fraud check record remains for compliance.
   *
   * Validation includes ensuring the new score is within allowed thresholds,
   * that the decision/status is one of {Pass, Review, Fail}, and that only
   * designated fields are modifiable as per business and regulatory
   * requirements (PCI-DSS, AML, etc).
   *
   * Error responses include: NotFound for invalid ids, Forbidden for
   * insufficient permissions, and ValidationError for
   * out-of-range/unsupported fields. All changes trigger an audit log entry
   * recording the actor and operation (GDPR/PCI compliance).
   *
   * This endpoint should be used in conjunction with GET /aiFraudChecks/{id}
   * for retrieving the original record, and DELETE /aiFraudChecks/{id} for
   * soft deletion/audit needs. It is recommended (per compliance) that update
   * privileges are RBAC controlled and restricted to compliance or infosec
   * staff.
   *
   * @param id The UUID of the AI fraud check record to update.
   * @param body Fields to update in the AI fraud check record. Must conform
   *   to compliance/audit policies for fraud scoring.

  /**
   * Soft-delete an AI fraud check record by id.
   *
   * This endpoint performs a soft-deletion of a specified AI fraud check
   * record in the ai_fraud_checks table. The deletion is performed by
   * updating the deleted_at field with the current timestamp, rather than a
   * hard database removal, to preserve immutable audit history as required
   * for legal, regulatory, and compliance (e.g., PCI DSS, GDPR, AML)
   * purposes.
   *
   * The operation is only available to users with appropriate permissions
   * (RBAC enforced), typically restricted to admins, compliance staff, or
   * designated system processes. Any soft-delete action is strictly logged,
   * including the deleting actor, reason (if provided), and timestamp.
   *
   * Attempting to delete a non-existent or already deleted fraud check
   * returns a NotFound error. Deleting a fraud check with active/completed
   * status may require additional justification or override privilege.
   *
   * Related endpoints include PUT /aiFraudChecks/{id} for record
   * corrections/updates and GET /aiFraudChecks/{id} for retrieval. Deletion
   * should not break historical audit chains or downstream audit/export

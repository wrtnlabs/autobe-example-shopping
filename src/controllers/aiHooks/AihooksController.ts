   * registrations are created for the same channel/entity. Audit logs should
   * record API creation. Error handling returns descriptive messages for
   * invalid or duplicate data. This endpoint is related to PATCH /aiHooks

   * This endpoint queries the ai_hooks table, returning a paginated response
   * containing AI hook registration records, filtered by optional
   * search/sorting criteria provided in the request body. This is essential
   * for administering the platform's modular AI layerâ€”listing hooks
   * responsible for entity enrichment, anomaly detection, and analytics.
   * Security policies restrict access to users with admin or developer
   * rights. The endpoint enforces compliance with channel boundaries
   * (multi-tenancy) if required. Business logic includes supporting dynamic
   * search by channel, target_entity_type, status (enabled/disabled), and
   * date ranges. The pagination interface ensures efficient queries for
   * potentially large sets. Error handling covers invalid filters, missing
   * search criteria or pagination parameters, and unauthorized access
   * attempts. Related endpoints: POST /aiHooks for creation, GET
   * /aiHooks/{id} for one record, PUT /aiHooks/{id} for update, DELETE
   * /aiHooks/{id} for removal.

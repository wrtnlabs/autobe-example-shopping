   * RBAC enforced: Only allowed for system actors, analytics, or compliance
   * officers. Each log is immutable after insert, except via PUT
   * (override/correction) or DELETE (soft-delete). Insert must trigger audit
   * notification/log per section 9 (Compliance/Auditability). Edge error:
   * missing required fields or duplicate log handling. Use with PATCH (list),
   * GET (read), PUT (edit), DELETE (soft-delete).

   * Returns a paginated list of ai_log records, each representing a logged

   * provider. As required by sections 10 (AI/ML, Analytics) and 9
   * (Compliance), this endpoint powers analytics and audit dashboards with
   * search/filter/page capabilities.
   *
   * Filtering allows querying on user, provider, event_type
   * (input/output/error), time window, status, etc. Advanced queries are
   * provided via IAnalyticsAiLog.IRequest, supporting compliance audit and
   * root-cause analysis. Returns IPageIAnalyticsAiLog containing hit
   * summaries. RBAC: access restricted to analytics staff and admins only.
   *
   * Related: Use with POST (log new AI event), GET (log detail view), PUT
   * (manual update/correction, compliance), DELETE (soft-delete) for log
   * lifecycle. Edge cases: malformed filters, excessive page sizes/errors,
   * unauthorized access are returned as errors per API policy.

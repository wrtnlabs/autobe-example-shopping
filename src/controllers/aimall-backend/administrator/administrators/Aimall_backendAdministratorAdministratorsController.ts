   * permissions as mapped to the aimall_backend_permissions table. Used in
   * admin-facing dashboards or compliance reporting. Excessive requests may
   * be rate-limited or logged for monitoring.

   * The administrator list supports other operations such as role assignment
   * (see permissions endpoints), and audit logging (see analytics domain).

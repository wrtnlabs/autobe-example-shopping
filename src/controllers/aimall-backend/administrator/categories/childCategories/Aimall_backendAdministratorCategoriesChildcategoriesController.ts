   * category. The aimall_backend_categories table uses the parent_id column
   * to model category nesting and supports up to three levels of hierarchy
   * for product taxonomy.
   *
   * This API enables customers, sellers, and administrators to fetch all
   * immediately subordinate categories, facilitating faceted navigation,
   * dynamic menu generation, or administrative updates. The operation checks
   * that the specified category exists and then finds all categories with
   * parent_id equal to categoryId, ensuring strong data integrity and
   * enforcing the unique constraint (parent_id, name) for category names.
   *
   * Only categories that exist (not deleted) are returned; you may filter or
   * restrict based on your access policies. This endpoint can be used for
   * recursive traversal by repeatedly calling it on child categories, and is
   * essential for deep-linking and analytics on verticals.
   *
   * Error behavior: If the given categoryId does not exist, a not found error
   * will be returned; if the parent category has no children, an empty array
   * is returned.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param categoryId Unique identifier of the parent category whose children
   *   will be listed.

   * parent, a conflict error will occur. If the parentId does not exist, the

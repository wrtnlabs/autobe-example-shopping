   * channel in the system, including unique identifiers, channel codes,
   * display names, enabled flags, and audit timestamps. It closely aligns
   * with the channel governance requirements of the system, preserving strict
   * normalization and avoiding denormalized or computed values.
   *
   * Security-wise, this endpoint is typically reserved for administrators, as
   * channels directly affect content delivery and routing within the system.
   * However, other elevated roles involved in configuration or reporting may
   * also be granted access based on the business’s access control policy. The
   * response will present the channel entity structure as defined in the
   * Prisma schema, enabling the administrator to view all necessary fields
   * for each channel, and can be used in conjunction with creation, update,
   * and section management APIs for a complete channel administration
   * workflow.
   *
   * Error scenarios include unauthorized access, database connectivity
   * issues, or inconsistent/incomplete entities. Validation is unnecessary
   * for this operation as no parameters are involved.

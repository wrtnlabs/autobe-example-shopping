   * reversals—recorded in the aimall_backend_loyalty_transactions table. Each
   * record details a single atomic loyalty event featuring the customer, any

   * or the relevant customer can access these data. The endpoint may be used
   * in conjunction with search or reporting systems. Pagination ensures
   * efficient handling for large datasets, while audit trails allow analysis
   * of user- and order-level point activity. No net balances are provided
   * here—clients should compute as needed.
   *
   * If an unauthorized party attempts to access another user's history,
   * access must be denied and all such attempts should be recorded in audit
   * logs, in compliance with non-functional security requirements.

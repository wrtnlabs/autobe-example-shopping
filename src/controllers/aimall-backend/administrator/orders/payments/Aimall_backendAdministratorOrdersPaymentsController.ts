   * querying of multiple types of payment events tied to a single order,
   * reflecting the real-world scenario where an order may be paid through
   * several different channels (e.g., credit card, coupon, points). By
   * providing the orderId as a path parameter, users can access all related
   * payment records, which support business audit, reporting, and
   * reconciliation.
   *
   * Access is strictly enforced: only users with appropriate roles (the
   * ordering customer, involved seller, or platform administrator) are
   * authorized to view payment details, ensuring no leakage of transaction or
   * PII data. This endpoint is commonly paired with order retrieval and
   * payment audit tools for robust financial tracking.

   * @param orderId Unique identifier of the order whose payments are being

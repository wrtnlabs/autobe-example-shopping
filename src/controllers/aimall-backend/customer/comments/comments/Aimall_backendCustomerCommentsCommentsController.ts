   * Get all child comments under a parent comment (thread expansion).
   *
   * This endpoint retrieves the direct replies (child comments) to a specific
   * parent comment as identified by 'commentId' in the
   * aimall_backend_comments schema. Each returned comment includes relevant
   * atomic properties such as id, body, customer_id, created_at, updated_at,
   * is_private, and parent_id. The system filters out any comments with
   * non-null deleted_at, ensuring only active/visible comments are listed.
   *
   * Access to replies may depend on thread privacy (is_private field) and the
   * authorization role of the requesting user. Customers can see their own
   * comments and public threads; administrators may review hidden/private
   * comments for moderation purposes. The endpoint builds fully on the
   * 'parent_id' foreign key to allow recursive thread expansion in community
   * features.
   *
   * Sorting and pagination are implementation-dependent (e.g.,
   * page/limit/query params) and expected to be supported for UX scalability.
   * Errors such as comment not found, access denied, or invalid UUID are
   * handled gracefully with informative messages. Behavior aligns with audit,
   * compliance, and privacy logic described in the community requirements.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param commentId The UUID of the parent comment whose child comments are
   *   to be retrieved.

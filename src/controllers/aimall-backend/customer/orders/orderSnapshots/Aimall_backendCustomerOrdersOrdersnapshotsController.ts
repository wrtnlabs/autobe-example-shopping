   * types, or matching structured metadata as stored in the
   * 'aimall_backend_order_snapshots' table.
   *
   * The operation requires at least an orderId and may support additional
   * filter fields (type, timestamp range, etc.) as per the request body
   * schema. Access control mimics the GET endpoint but typically allows more
   * granular extraction suitable for analytics and compliance.

   * their own records.

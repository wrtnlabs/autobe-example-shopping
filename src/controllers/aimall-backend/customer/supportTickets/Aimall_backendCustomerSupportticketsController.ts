   * operation enables general ticket queue views, backlog analysis, and
   * listing personal or platform-incoming support queries.
   *
   * Access is role-controlled. Customers only see their own tickets. Sellers
   * might view ones they opened, administrators can list and search all
   * tickets for triage, reporting, and assignment. Ticket data includes
   * subject, body, priority, status, requester (with minimal user details),
   * assignee, timestamps, and category.
   *
   * The listing supports pagination and sorting via query params (not
   * reflected as path parameters here, but in implementation via
   * request/query body or OpenAPI). Backend logic should ensure result size
   * limits and rate limiting. The endpoint also allows for auditor queries
   * and compliance review but never exposes hidden ticket content out of
   * scope for user role.
   *
   * Related operations: PATCH for advanced filtering, GET by ID for details.

   * Retrieves a paginated, sorted list of active reviews from the

   * customer_id, title, body, rating, created_at, updated_at. Consumers may
   * limit output via product, author, or rating criteria through query
   * parameters (not shown in this get spec, but standard in REST).
   * Soft-deleted reviews are hidden in normal queries per compliance rules.
   *
   * Read access is public but may restrict certain private details based on
   * user role and data sensitivity (e.g., some review info is limited to
   * admins). The operation supports core product UX (e.g. review display) and
   * analytic systems. Proper error and validation handling provided for edge
   * case queries.

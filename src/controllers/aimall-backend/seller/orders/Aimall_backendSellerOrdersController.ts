   * aggregates.
   *
   * Related endpoints include search/filter endpoints, order item detail
   * queries, and order mutation APIs. Security audits and error handling
   * ensure all accesses and failures (such as overreaching permissions or
   * record not found) are logged for compliance. The response data structure
   * mirrors the Prisma order table definition and is intended for list view
   * or dashboard consumption.

   * Best used in analytic reporting, case management back office, or sales

   * category, seller, title, status, and optional description or thumbnail.
   *
   * Product creation is restricted to authenticated users with appropriate
   * privileges, typically sellers (for their own products) or administrators
   * (for marketplace management). The endpoint enforces validation of foreign
   * keys, uniqueness of seller/title pairs, and proper data typing for all
   * attributes. Security policies require all call attempts to be properly
   * authenticated and authorized based on the actor's role.
   *
   * On creation, the system populates automatic fields such as product ID,
   * created_at, and updated_at. Failure modes include invalid data, missing
   * required fields, unauthorized access, or foreign key violations, with
   * descriptive error feedback.

   * are rejected. The endpoint updates updated_at field to the current
   * timestamp and returns the complete, updated product entity.
   *

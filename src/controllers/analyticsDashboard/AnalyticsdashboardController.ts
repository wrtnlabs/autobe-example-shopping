   *
   * This operation retrieves a paginated and filterable list of analytics
   * dashboards, supporting search, sort, and other filters as described in
   * the analytics_dashboard Prisma schema and requirements. Each dashboard
   * record is tied to an owner (user/admin/seller), and displays

   * for, as per requirements for RBAC and compliance audit.
   *
   * Dashboards must be filterable by owner, type, and deletion status.
   * Pagination and sorting are required for performance and UX. If search
   * tokens are present, dashboards are matched via name/description fields
   * using full-text indexes (see schema's GIN index on name).
   *
   * Returned dashboards represent the current active state unless a
   * historical view is requested through additional parameters (not in basic
   * PATCH). Related operations: GET returns specific dashboard info, POST
   * creates, PUT updates, DELETE performs soft delete. Errors include 403 on
   * insufficient permission, 400 on bad input, and 500 on system/internal
   * errors.

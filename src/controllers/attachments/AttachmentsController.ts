   * Create a new attachment (attachments table).

   * This endpoint is used to register a new attachment file in the system, by
   * creating a new record with file metadata (file name, url, type, size,
   * version, etc.) after a successful upload. It does not store the file
   * binary itself; instead, it registers the CDN/object storage location.
   *
   * Only authorized actors can create new attachment records, and all actions
   * are logged for audit. Validation ensures no duplicate urls or filenames
   * in the applicable context, and required metadata (type, size, version) is
   * checked.
   *
   * On success, the endpoint returns the newly registered attachment with all
   * metadata fields. Related endpoints include PATCH (list), GET (retrieve),
   * PUT (update), and DELETE (soft-delete).
   *
   * @param body Attachment file metadata after upload (filename, url, type,
   *   size, version).

   * attachments by filename, MIME type, creation time, size, or other
   * metadata fields. Channel, entity, or user scoping can be supported as
   * query/filter fields.
   *
   * Access to this endpoint is typically permission-controlled, with only
   * authorized users (admins, sellers) able to list all attachments.

   * supported. Search results exclude soft-deleted (deleted_at set)
   * attachments by default, unless explicitly requested for audit.

   * operation is typically used before associating attachments with products,

   * file updates.
   *
   * Authorization is required, typically for admins or entity/resource
   * owners. Updated metadata is validated for consistency (e.g., duplicate

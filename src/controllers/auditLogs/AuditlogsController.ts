   * (user_id, event_type, event_reason, event_context, actor_id) for

   * log object. Creating audit logs is a critical compliance featureâ€”errors
   * in logging must be alerted/escalated for system monitoring.
   *
   * If provided fields are invalid or not authorized, the endpoint returns a
   * validation/permission error. On success, the new record is returned.
   * Notification or side effects (e.g., compliance alerts) are handled
   * separately, outside this endpoint.

   * This endpoint allows updates to an audit log entry by its unique ID, for
   * exceptional, compliance-driven scenarios (such as correcting an error in
   * logged context, or retroactively attaching justification/notes).
   * Normally, audit logs are immutable, but this endpoint is guarded by

   *
   * The update payload must match permitted/required fields in

   * appropriate error. Only admins/compliance users (per RBAC assignment) may

   * (soft-delete) for compliance, not erasing the immutable history.

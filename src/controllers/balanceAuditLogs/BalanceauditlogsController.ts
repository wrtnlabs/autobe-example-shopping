   * Create a new balance audit log entry (balance_audit_logs table,

   * Creates a new audit log entry for user balance changes. Used by system or

   * interventions occur with user balances, deposits, or mileage. Request
   * body (see IBalanceAuditLog.ICreate) includes user_id, amount, event_type
   * ('credit', 'debit', 'adjustment', etc.), balance_type, description, and
   * optional reference (event_ref). Status is always completed.
   *
   * Validation rules: user existence, amount sign according to event_type
   * (credit=positive, debit=negative), balance_type required, optional refs
   * must reference active entities. Audit log is immutable. Returns created
   * entity with all audit fields. Errors: 400 (validation), 403 (forbidden),
   * 404 (user/balance not found).
   *
   * @param body New audit log event data; see IBalanceAuditLog.ICreate.

   * PromotionsBalances schemas. The request body may include pagination meta,

   *
   * Typical uses: admin review of balance changes, compliance logs for
   * customer demands, internal fraud checks. Access restricted to
   * admin/system roles per RBAC. Error cases: 400 on invalid filter, 401/403
   * on access error. Data is read-only via this endpoint.

  /**
   * Soft-delete a balance audit log by ID (balance_audit_logs table).
   *
   * This API endpoint allows authorized users (typically admins or auditors)
   * to soft-delete a specific balance audit log entry by its unique ID. The
   * deletion is non-destructive, meaning the record is marked as deleted via
   * the deleted_at field but remains retrievable for compliance audits,
   * fulfilling the regulatory requirements for immutable history and
   * auditability.
   *
   * Access to this endpoint should be tightly controlled through RBAC, as
   * audit log deletion may impact compliance reporting. The operation updates
   * only the targeted log entry and does not affect related balance records.
   * If the log entry is already marked as deleted or does not exist, an error
   * indicating 'not found' or 'already deleted' is returned.
   *
   * Calling this operation does not delete any user or financial record; its
   * sole purpose is compliance-driven log management. Related APIs include
   * creation and search of balance audit logs for investigation workflows.
   *
   * Error handling includes 404 for nonexistent IDs and 403 for insufficient
   * permissions.
   *
   * @param id Unique identifier of the balance audit log to be soft-deleted.

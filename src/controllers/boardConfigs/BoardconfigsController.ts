   * Create a board configuration (board_configs table).
   *
   * This endpoint is used to create a board configuration object that defines
   * behavior, policies, and permissions for boards (discussion
   * forums/Q&A/content spaces) throughout the system. The operation allows
   * administrators to specify the configuration's name, a JSON structure of
   * settings (for permissions, moderation rules, etc.), and its version.
   *
   * Security: Only admin or superadmin roles should be able to access this
   * endpoint, as board configurations control business rules and user
   * permissions. All actions are logged for audit, and inputs are validated
   * for JSON schema compliance.
   *
   * Schema: board_configs - atomic fields include id (autogenerated UUID),
   * name (unique for version), settings_json (arbitrary structure, required),
   * version (integer, required), created_at (auto), and relations to boards.
   * Board configs are versioned for audit and rollback, allowing attribute
   * evolution without re-writing all consumer boards. Validation ensures
   * duplicate name+version is blocked.
   *
   * Related: After creating a configuration, a 'board' record may be created
   * or updated to reference this config. To update a configuration, use PUT
   * /boardConfigs/{id}, and to delete a config safely (soft delete), use
   * DELETE /boardConfigs/{id}.
   *
   * @param body The payload specifying the name, settings JSON, and version
   *   of the board configuration to create.

   * Retrieve paginated, filterable list of board configuration templates from

   *
   * This endpoint delivers a paginated, filterable list of board
   * configuration records as stored in the 'board_configs' table, forming the
   * policy/configuration layer for engagement boards and forums. Each config
   * entry includes version, name, serialized settings (JSON), and
   * timestamp—enabling boards to refer to or share configs for permission,
   * moderation, or AI settings.
   *
   * Clients provide advanced filter, pagination, and sort instructions within
   * the request body, often by searching config name, version, timestamp, or
   * even JSON field presence. The endpoint is typically used for admin
   * configuration dashboards, new board onboarding, and compliance/config
   * audits. All access is role/permission-controlled. Standard errors: 400
   * (validation), 403 (no privilege), 500 (system fault).

   * Board configs define granular engagement rules, moderation flags, and AI
   * integration/policies—typically referenced polymorphically by many boards.

   * (JSON), version, timestamps. Used for onboarding, admin settings, or
   * analytical dashboard display.

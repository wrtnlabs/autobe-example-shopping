  /**
   * Soft-delete a specific board post (Engagement Boards: board_posts table)
   * by ID, maintaining audit trail.
   *
   * This API operation allows authorized users (the original author, a
   * designated board moderator, or an administrator with sufficient
   * privileges) to mark a board post as deleted. The operation targets the
   * 'board_posts' entity in the Engagement & Board System domain.
   *
   * Upon invocation, the 'deleted_at' timestamp is set for the specified post
   * rather than physically removing the record, to meet compliance,
   * auditability, and regulatory requirements (GDPR/CCPA, as described in the
   * requirements and the Prisma schema). This means all deleted posts are
   * still available for audit and export as necessary but are hidden from
   * standard user queries unless the user is authorized for
   * advanced/administrative visibility.
   *
   * The 'id' parameter must represent a valid existing board post. The
   * backend must verify that the acting user has the right to remove the post
   * (either original author, moderator, or admin) according to RBAC
   * permissions/resources. Attempts to delete already-deleted or non-existing
   * posts must return appropriate error codes/messages.
   *
   * This is commonly used with PATCH (listing/searching posts), GET
   * (retrieving one), and PUT (updating); soft deletion maintains persistent
   * history for all board activity as per compliance and business
   * requirements.
   *
   * @param id ID of the board post to soft-delete.

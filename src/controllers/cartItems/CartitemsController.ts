   * Create a new cart item in the cart_items table.

   * This API endpoint creates a new cart_items record, representing the
   * addition of a product variant to a user’s persistent or guest cart.
   * Clients must supply a valid cart reference, product_variant_id, quantity,
   * and optional note fields, as described by the schema for atomic,
   * normalized cart item creation.
   *
   * All creation events are validated for business rules (e.g., cart must
   * exist and not be deleted, variant must be valid, user/session scoping
   * must be respected). On success, the newly created cart item is returned
   * with its unique ID.
   *
   * Changes to the cart and item tables are audit-logged in accordance with
   * compliance requirements. Duplicate entries for the same cart/variant are
   * rejected—quantity mods must use PUT instead.
   *
   * Error responses are issued for failed validations, permission issues, or
   * logical conflicts (duplicate, full cart, inventory violations). For batch
   * and search, use PATCH /cartItems.
   *
   * @param body New cart item details (cart, product variant, quantity,

   * Retrieve a paginated list of cart items from the cart_items table.

   * use in cart interfaces or batch item listings, this endpoint supports
   * business requirements around persistent cart management, cart migrations,
   * and audit/report flows as outlined in Cart & Order.
   *
   * Clients can request filtered lists (for example, by cart ID, product
   * variant, date range, or note) as well as pagination and sorting per API
   * standards. The operation is strictly read-only and does not modify any
   * data.

   * Error cases, such as invalid filters or RBAC violations, yield clear
   * error codes.

   * For retrieving single items, use GET /cartItems/{id}. To add or remove
   * items use POST or DELETE accordingly. The endpoint is also used in

   * Replace or update an existing cart item by its ID in the cart_items

   *
   * This API operation updates an existing entry in the cart_items table,
   * replacing all atomic fields for the specified cart item. Fields that can
   * be updated include the referenced cart, product_variant, quantity, and
   * (optionally) the note. This supports Cart & Order requirements for
   * dynamic, real-time cart changes—for example, updating the quantity or
   * swapping options.
   *
   * Business logic requires that a cart item’s uniqueness is preserved
   * (cart_id, product_variant_id); the operation enforces no duplicates when
   * updating. Updating sets the 'updated_at' timestamp for full
   * auditability.
   *
   * All changes are subject to cart-item validation, user/session context
   * checking, and RBAC enforcement. Errors are returned for permission
   * violations, non-existent cart items, or logical/data conflicts. Related
   * endpoints for adding or deleting items are defined on POST and DELETE of

   * returns an error. Authorization is enforced by matching cart, user, or

   * last update timestamp for accurate recency tracking.

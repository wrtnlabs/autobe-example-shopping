   * Create a new cart template in the cart_templates table.

   * This API operation creates a new cart_templates record, representing a

   * supports functional requirements for persistent carts, allowing users to
   * name, save, and later load predefined cart configurations (see Cart &
   * Order).
   *
   * Clients must provide a valid user reference, a template name, and other
   * required metadata (creation time, etc.). The new template is validated,
   * persisted, and returned with its assigned ID.
   *
   * All creations are logged for audit/compliance, and permission checks are
   * performed by matching session/user context. Name uniqueness is enforced
   * per user. Errors are returned for failed validation or business rule
   * conflicts.
   *
   * For retrieving templates, use PATCH/GET endpoints. For updating or
   * deleting, see PUT/DELETE /cartTemplates/{id}.
   *
   * @param body Details for the new cart template (user ID, name).

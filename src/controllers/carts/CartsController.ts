   * Create a new shopping cart (member or guest) with optional initial

   * This operation creates a new shopping cart (possibly with initial
   * contents) for the authenticated user or guest (session_token provided).
   * The CartOrder.carts table supports multiple carts per user or session
   * (e.g., guest session and later migration to member).
   *
   * On creation, mandatory fields are: user_id (if authenticated, optional
   * for guest), and session_token (identifies guest cart until login).
   * Optionally, initial cart_items may be created.
   *
   * Business logic: Cart expiration is calculated on creation (configurable).
   * Duplicate cart creation with the same session_token/user is prevented
   * (enforced by DB unique constraints).
   *
   * Success returns full cart info (ID, status, items, expiry, etc.). Access
   * is restricted to the owner. Errors include violation of unique
   * constraints, invalid or expired session_token, and permission checks.
   * This endpoint complements cart listing, detail, and item-editing APIs.

   * @param body Cart creation info (may include items, session_token,
   *   user_id).

   * analytics, and migration on login. Errors include invalid search params

  /**
   * Replace or update an existing cart by its ID in the carts table.
   *
   * This API operation allows updating or replacing the persistent shopping
   * cart identified by the provided cart ID. The carts table represents user
   * or session scoped shopping carts, supporting both guest and member flows
   * as outlined in Cart & Order requirements. The operation requires a full
   * update of the atomic cart state, such as user assignment (migrating guest
   * to member), session token changes (e.g., after login), or updating
   * expiration logic.
   *
   * When a cart is updated, new metadata (like extension of expiry or session
   * handoff) triggers compliance tracking via audit fields (e.g.,
   * updated_at). User and session linkage are validated; associated cart
   * items are NOT affected and remain intact unless separately updated
   * through cart item endpoints. All changes are strictly audit-logged to
   * meet regulatory traceability.
   *
   * This operation enforces full replacement of the specified cart resource,
   * not partial patching. In accordance with soft delete policy, 'deleted_at'
   * may be set to force logical deletion.
   *
   * Related operations include creating a new cart (POST /carts) or deleting
   * a cart (DELETE /carts/{id}). For managing cart items, dedicated endpoints
   * (e.g., /cartItems) are used.
   *
   * On error, validation failures (invalid user/session or expired cart)
   * return explicit error codes. Soft delete compliance is enforced in all
   * flows by marking 'deleted_at', not physical deletion.
   *
   * @param id Unique identifier for the target cart.
   * @param body Updated cart entity data.

   * enforces soft delete across all shopping carts in the system to meet
   * compliance, full audit, and reversibility requirements specified in Cart
   * & Order.
   *
   * When invoked, this endpoint updates the 'deleted_at' column for the
   * specified cart record, marking it as deleted but retaining the record for
   * later audit analysis or undelete flows if necessary. Attempting to delete
   * a non-existent or already deleted cart returns an error with reason.
   *
   * Related endpoints include creating a cart (POST /carts), updating a cart
   * (PUT /carts/{id}), and managing cart items separately. Carts must be
   * referenced using their unique identifier and must match RBAC and session
   * ownership rules to protect user/session scoping integrity.

   * Create a new category (categories table).
   *
   * This endpoint serves to create a new category in the shopping mall
   * backend, implementing the flexible multi-level category tree required for
   * channel-specific product organization. Category creation supports
   * assigning a parent for nesting, a unique code per channel/parent, and
   * descriptive metadata for SEO/search.
   *
   * RBAC and permissions must be checked, typically allowing only
   * administrators or privileged sellers to create categories. Audit logs
   * should capture creation actions, including timestamp and actor.
   * Categories are affiliated to a channel, and validation ensures code
   * uniqueness within context.
   *
   * The operation will reject attempts to create duplicate codes within the
   * same parent or channel, and will return error messages for
   * missing/invalid data or insufficient permissions. Typical related actions
   * are listing categories (/categories PATCH), updating a category (PUT),
   * and soft-deleting (DELETE).
   *
   * @param body Category creation data including code, name, parent, and
   *   channel.

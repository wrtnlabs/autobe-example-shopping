   * permissions (typically admins) to locate and manage storefront or brand
   * contexts at scale. All Channel data includes metadata, including
   * audit/log fields such as created_at, updated_at, and deleted_at.
   *
   * User permissions are enforced (RBAC); deleted (soft-deleted) channels can
   * be optionally included/excluded for compliance. All search and filter
   * behavior is aligned with the 'channels' Prisma model, with parameters for
   * code, name, date range, and soft delete status. Complex query
   * construction and security rules are supported.
   *
   * This endpoint works in concert with Channel create, update, get and
   * delete APIs, providing an entry point for channel-level configuration and
   * navigation. Validation ensures no security breach or data leakage
   * regarding administrative metadata. Error responses include RBAC
   * violations and invalid filter values.

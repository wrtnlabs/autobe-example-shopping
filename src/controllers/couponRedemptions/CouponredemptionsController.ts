   * Create a new coupon redemption record in 'coupon_redemptions'.

   * redemption event, whether as part of user-initiated claiming, automatic
   * system assignment, or code-based redemption. The operation performs
   * extensive validation, including coupon existence, not exceeding
   * redemption quotas, user eligibility, claim period checks, and optionally,
   * fraud screening. All mutation attempts are logged for compliance. The
   * resulting record includes user/coupon linkage, status, timestamps, and
   * fraud check reference if present. Errors include eligibility failure,
   * duplicate attempts, or business logic/rate limits. RBAC ensures only
   * authorized flows can invoke this. Related endpoints: coupon creation,
   * user assignment APIs. Used by mobile apps, web portals, and admin
   * systems.
   *
   * @param body Coupon redemption creation info: user, coupon, claim
   *   timestamp, optional fraud reference.

   * service. The endpoint enforces RBAC so that only authorized roles can
   * view redemption history, including sensitive information about user,
   * coupon, fraud checks, and state transitions. The response data contains
   * per-redemption entity details, including assignment and usage timestamps,
   * linked coupon and user IDs, redemption outcome state, and optionally a
   * reference to any anti-fraud review. All filter parameters are validated
   * against legal/business constraints. The operation is critical for
   * supporting compliance auditing, campaign effectiveness review, and user
   * entitlement resolution. Related endpoints: coupon creation, redemption
   * status update, and fraud check audits. In the event of non-compliant
   * access or unsupported filters, descriptive errors are returned. Typical
   * pagination includes page size, number, filters on redemption status,
   * date, coupon, and user identity.

   * @param body Redemption query, filtering, and pagination options.

   * Create a new coupon (POST /coupons).

   * This endpoint creates a new coupon in the coupons table, supporting all
   * coupon types (public, private, code-based) and settings as required by
   * the campaign, business, and compliance requirements. The request body
   * conforms to the ICouponCreate schema, enforcing validation on required
   * fields (channel, code/type, expiry, limits, stacking, etc).
   *
   * Only authorized staff (typically admins, marketing, or partner
   * integration systems) may access this operationâ€”RBAC-restricted. Created
   * records automatically log audit trails including creator and timestamps
   * for later compliance export. Upon success, the full coupon record
   * (ICoupon) is returned including system-assigned uuid.
   *
   * Error responses include: Conflict (for duplicate code or rules),
   * Validation errors, and Forbidden (insufficient privilege).
   *
   * Recommended related endpoints: PATCH /coupons for advanced list/search,
   * GET /coupons/{id} for retrieval, PUT /coupons/{id} for full update.
   *
   * Deletion via DELETE /coupons/{id}. Use PUT for full record update; PATCH
   * for partial update is not recommended for compliance fields.
   *
   * @param body Coupon creation information (required fields: type,
   *   code/stacking, expiry, etc).

  /**
   * Search and list coupons with advanced filters (PATCH /coupons).

   * This endpoint enables authorized admins or partners to perform a complex
   * list/search query on the coupons table, supporting advanced filtering (by
   * code, channel, type, expiry, stackability), sorting, and
   * full-text/pattern matching for compliance and analytics.
   *
   * The request body conforms to ICouponSearchRequest schema, allowing
   * specification of filter fields (e.g., by status, valid/expired, usage
   * count), search term, sorting parameters (by expiry, creation, title), and
   * standard pagination (page, pageSize).
   *
   * Access is RBAC protected and typically available to marketing managers,
   * compliance auditors, or admin staff.
   *
   * Results are paginated as per the IPageICoupon response schema, including
   * coupon data and pagination metadata (total, page, pageSize, etc).
   *
   * This endpoint is recommended for backend/admin UIs for coupon management,
   * compliance audit exports, or data analysis pipelines. Use GET
   * /coupons/{id} to fetch a specific coupon by id. POST /coupons for
   * creation, and PUT /coupons/{id} for full update.
   *
   * @param body Search/filter criteria for coupon list retrieval.

   * Get a coupon by id (coupons table).
   *
   * This API operation fetches the full information of a single coupon by its
   * unique identifier (UUID) from the coupons table. This is the standard
   * detail retrieval endpoint for coupon management, auditing, and
   * customer-facing systems that validate coupon data before redemption or
   * display.
   *
   * Retrieval is RBAC-protected and can be accessed by admins, marketing
   * managers, compliance auditors, or systems needing to validate a coupon.
   * If the coupon is soft-deleted or expired, the status is returned in the
   * record for business/compliance clarity.
   *
   * Key use cases include: 1) Displaying coupon details for management or
   * redemption; 2) Validating coupon eligibility or rules client-side; 3)
   * Auditing coupon use, status, and campaign effectiveness.
   *
   * Returns 404 NotFound if the coupon id does not exist or is not visible to
   * the actor (based on soft-delete and RBAC rules). Related endpoints: PATCH

   * schema). It strictly logs old/new values for regulatory audit (e.g., for
   * tracking changes in coupon rules, expiry, eligibility, etc).
   *
   * Update operations are RBAC-restricted to authorized admins, marketing, or
   * compliance-controlled integrations. Change events are audit-logged with
   * actor, reason, and timestamp fields.
   *
   * If the coupon record does not exist, or is already soft-deleted, returns
   * NotFound. Validation and conflict errors (e.g., code duplication, invalid
   * expiry/limits) are handled as standard.

   * Related endpoints: GET /coupons/{id} for detail, POST /coupons for
   * creation, DELETE /coupons/{id} for removal. PATCH /coupons can be used

   * Create a new donation (donations table).

   * details including donating user (by ID), amount, target, status, event
   * reference, and timestamp. The API validates the payload according to
   * business rules and campaign compliance, then persists the donation. After
   * creation, the new donation object (with assigned ID, status, linkage to
   * refund or related entity as needed) is returned.
   *
   * RBAC and compliance business rules determine which users or
   * administrators may initiate donations and the kinds of targets eligible
   * for donations (configured per campaign, region, or organization
   * policies). The endpoint is critical for donation campaign onboarding,
   * refund-to-donation workflows, and audit trails of non-profit flows.
   * Additional actions (like notification or export) may be triggered on
   * successful creation.
   *
   * Error handling: validation errors, policy/procedure errors (e.g.,
   * unapproved targets), and RBAC permission failures.
   *
   * @param body Donation creation details (user, amount, target, etc).

  /**
   * Search and list paginated donations (donations table).
   *
   * This API finds and returns a filtered, sorted, and paginated page of
   * donation records from the 'donations' table. Filters may include user ID,
   * status, donation target, completion window, amount, and other
   * compliance-sensitive or business-relevant properties. Extensible design
   * allows for new filter types as future business needs evolve.
   *
   * Supports robust pagination and sort for high-volume donation programs.
   * Used in dashboards, compliance exports, or user self-service views.
   * Results do not expose direct PII but reference users/entities; details
   * can be fetched individually via detail endpoints.
   *
   * Strict RBAC and contextual permission ensure only authorized users (e.g.,
   * admins, compliance, or campaign managers) access the listing.
   *
   * Error handling: input validation, RBAC failures, and not found errors for
   * improper queries. This operation is useful for reporting, analytics, or
   * regulatory export automation.

   * Create a new product exchange request for an order item (after-sales).

   * Registers a new exchange event in the exchanges table, tying to a target
   * order item and user (requester), with provided reason, workflow
   * annotation, and organizational data. Validation ensures the order item is
   * eligible (not already returned/exchanged), business logic is followed,
   * and initiating user permissions are checked (customers, sellers, or
   * admins). Upon creation, exchange status starts at 'requested', to be
   * transitioned by further workflow endpoints (such as approval, shipment,
   * completion).
   *
   * Storefront UIs or service bots use this endpoint for after-sales
   * exchanges; audit trails and workflow dependencies reference this entity
   * for complete compliance.
   *
   * Errors: Ineligible order item, business rule violations, permission
   * denials are handled with standard API error contracts.
   *
   * @param body Exchange creation payload with target order item, user,
   *   reason, workflow context.

   * Retrieve a paginated, filtered list of exchange records (after-sales

   *
   * This endpoint returns a paginated and filterable list of exchange
   * requests, enabling advanced UI search/reporting (e.g., by user, item,
   * date, status, or exchange reason). Exchange records are created when
   * users initiate an exchange for a purchased order item (wrong size/color,
   * etc). Returned fields include all atomic/normalized columns: order item,
   * user, reason, status, timestamps.

   * Security: RBAC enforcement ensures only permitted users see results
   * (customers see their own, sellers/admins see broader scope). All returned
   * data respects privacy masking as required by API policy.

   * retrieval for exchanges. List result may be used in analytics/reporting.

   * inventory update) are executed by workflow subsystems as required, not by
   * this API directly.

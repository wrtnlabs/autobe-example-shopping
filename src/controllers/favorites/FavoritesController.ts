   * Add a favorite entry for the current user and entity

   *
   * This endpoint allows an authenticated user to mark an entity (product,
   * inquiry, address, etc.) as a favorite. The client provides the
   * entity_type, entity_id, and the reference snapshot id. Handles checks:
   *
   * - The snapshot must match the entity and exist (and not be deleted).
   * - The combination of user, entity_type, and entity_id must be unique
   *   (cannot favorite same object twice).
   *
   * Business logic:
   *
   * - If already favorited, may return an error or silently ignore, depending
   *   on policy.
   * - May trigger notifications (opt-in state) or event hooks.
   *
   * Audit logs are created for compliance/rollback. Related APIs: favorite
   * list/search (PATCH), favorite detail (GET), update (PUT), delete
   * (DELETE). Errors: validation fails if target object/snapshot/entity is
   * missing.
   *
   * @param body Favorite creation info (entity_type, entity_id, snapshot).

   * List and search the authenticated user's favorites with

   *
   * Fetches a paginated, filterable list of favorite items (snapshots) for
   * the authenticated user. The 'favorites' table supports favoriting
   * products, inquiries, addresses, etc., by linking to an entity type,
   * entity id, and a referenced snapshot. This operation allows
   * searching/filtering by entity_type (e.g., 'product', 'inquiry'), sorting
   * (by created date, etc.), and supports pagination for large result sets.
   *
   * RBAC is enforced: only the user's own favorites are returned.
   * Deleted/expired targets (where the snapshot or entity is deleted) may be

   * populating user dashboards, notification settings, re-adding favorites
   * after changes, auditing user engagement.

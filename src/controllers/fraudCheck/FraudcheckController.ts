   * target type, AI provider, risk score, explanation text, and timestamp.
   * The endpoint enforces integrity (referenced user and AI provider exist),
   * privilege checks, and audit-logs the request. Typical use: during
   * checkout/transaction, the engine validates and returns the fraud check.
   * Returns the created record with all fields. Fails on missing/invalid
   * references or permissions. Used for compliance, security analytics, and
   * continuous improvement auditing.

  /**
   * Soft-deletes a fraud_check record by ID (AnalyticsAI.fraud_check table).
   *
   * This operation enables system or compliance administrators to delete a
   * fraud_check record, representing an AI/ML-powered transactional risk
   * assessment. Deletion here refers to soft-deletion (setting a deleted_at
   * timestamp) and is mandatory to comply with regulatory requirements for
   * data traceability and non-destructive audit trails, as described in
   * section 9 of the requirements.
   *
   * Fraud checks are crucial for monitoring order, cart, or refund activity
   * and are referenced by coupon_redemptions, payments, and order logs for
   * auditing and explainable outcomes. This endpoint must enforce RBAC so
   * only actors with required permission levels can delete records, and all
   * deletion actions are stored in the audit log for security and
   * compliance.
   *
   * Edge cases, such as the attempted deletion of an already-deleted
   * (soft-deleted) or non-existent record, must return detailed error
   * messages and should not trigger cascading deletes to related records. API
   * consumers should handle these gracefully. This API follows strict
   * immutability for analytics and legal complianceâ€”records are never
   * physically erased.
   *
   * Dependency: Only system administrators or compliance roles should be
   * granted this operation. Use together with /fraudCheck (GET, PATCH, POST,
   * PUT) for full fraud check management.
   *
   * @param id Target fraud check's ID to delete (UUID).

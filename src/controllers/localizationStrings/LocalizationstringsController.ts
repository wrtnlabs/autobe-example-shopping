   * the localization_strings Prisma schema, uniqueness is enforced across
   * key, locale, version; attempts to insert duplicates will fail with a
   * constraint error. On success, the complete normalized object is returned,

   * translation-authorized actors (admins, localization managers). Audit log
   * tracks all creation events for compliance and rollback. Validation
   * ensures all fields (key, locale, value, version) are present and
   * validâ€”missing or malformed data cause a validation error. Soft deletes
   * are not relevant at creation. Associated endpoints include PATCH for
   * list, GET/PUT/DELETE for entity management.

   *   fields: key, locale, value, and version, with optional context.

  /**
   * List/search/paginate localization string entries using filter/sort

   * This API endpoint enables searching, filtering, and paginating
   * system-wide localization strings. Each record represents a translatable
   * key-value pair, with locale, version, and context, normalized according
   * to the localization_strings schema. Query logic allows filter by key
   * (partial match), locale code, version, or context string; supports

   * parameters (limit, offset/page/size) enable scalable access. Sorting can
   * be done by key, locale, or version. Only records not soft-deleted
   * (excluding those with deleted_at set) are included. Designed for
   * admin-side localization management, translation QA/approval, or export
   * purposes.
   *
   * Permission gating ensures this access is allowed for qualified actors
   * (translation team, admin, etc.). Errors reported include invalid query
   * params, out-of-range limits, or permission failures. Returned data is

   * ... } }. Related endpoints include POST for creation, PUT for update, and

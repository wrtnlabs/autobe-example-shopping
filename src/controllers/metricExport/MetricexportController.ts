   * the 'metric_export' table. Clients provide details about which dashboard
   * is being exported, in what format, and with what configuration. The
   * endpoint will validate that the dashboard exists, the requesting
   * user/actor has the appropriate privileges to export, and that all
   * required fields (dashboard_id, export_format, configuration,
   * export_file_url, export_time, requested_by) are present. After
   * validation, an immutable record is created, and the audit trail is
   * updated for compliance reasons. Errors will be returned if validation
   * fails, if the dashboard is not found, or if the user is unauthorized.
   * This is typically used by analytics/report download UIs in admin or
   * seller dashboards.

   * set or update opt-in status for notifications (email, push, SMS, etc.),
   * or when onboarding new users. All required fields (user, channel,
   * notification_type, delivery_type, enabled) are validated. The permission
   * system restricts record creation to the user themselves or authorized
   * admin/support roles. On success, returns the newly created
   * notification_preferences object; on error, returns 400 (validation), 409
   * (conflict), or 403 (forbidden).
   *
   * Sensitive/PII handling: neither user nor channel are directly exposed
   * unless permitted. All creations are audit-logged for compliance.

  /**
   * Update a notification preference record (notification_preferences table)
   * by ID.
   *
   * This API operation allows modification of an existing notification
   * preference, identified by the provided unique ID. Notification
   * preferences are atomic records representing a user's opt-in or opt-out
   * choice for a given channel, notification type, and delivery type (such as
   * email, push, SMS) in the AI Shopping Mall Backend. According to the
   * notification_preferences Prisma schema, all properties are atomic and not
   * duplicated. The operation validates permissions: only the owner or
   * authorized admins can update this resource, and every change is
   * audit-logged. Validation ensures the referenced preference exists and
   * that the input does not violate unique constraints (a user cannot have
   * two preferences for the same [user, channel, notification_type,
   * delivery_type] tuple).
   *
   * Security controls and audit logging are enforced: every update event must
   * be attributed to the performing user and logged for compliance. The
   * system strictly prohibits changing unique identifiers via this operation;
   * only preference state or notification delivery fields may be updated. The
   * API returns the full updated notification preference object or detailed
   * error messages for permission denial, unique constraint violation, or
   * validation failure. Related API operations include GET for retrieving
   * preferences and DELETE for soft deleting a preference.
   *
   * Error cases covered: not found, permission denied, constraint violation,
   * and validation errors. Complies with the platform's requirement for
   * field-level audit and contextual RBAC.
   *
   * @param id Unique identifier of the notification preference to be updated.
   * @param body Updated fields for the notification preference record. Only
   *   controllable atomic fields (enabled, delivery type, etc.), excluding
   *   unique identifier.

   *
   * This API operation performs a soft delete of a notification preference,

   * soft deletes are implemented by setting the deleted_at timestamp on the
   * record, in compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and internal audit
   * requirementsâ€”physical deletion is prohibited for auditability. Only the
   * preference owner or an authorized admin can perform this operation, and
   * the event is audit-logged with the actor's ID for compliance review.
   * Deleting a preference disables notification delivery per
   * user/channel/type but allows restoration or audit during review periods.

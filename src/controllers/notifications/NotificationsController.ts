   * Create new notification event (NotificationLocalization.notifications).
   *
   * This API operation allows creation of a notification record, triggering a
   * delivery event through a specified channel and type (email, push, SMS,
   * in-app). All required fields (recipient user, channel, template, content,
   * send time, status, delivery type, payload) must be supplied and validated
   * before insertion in the notifications table. The operation ensures
   * audit-compliance by creating immutable delivery logs, supports sending to
   * multiple channels, tracks failures for reporting, and enforces strict
   * input validation.
   *
   * Business logic includes verifying that the recipient and channel exist,
   * the template is valid and active, and (optionally) that the sending
   * system/user has permission to notify the recipient. The payload and
   * delivery type determines downstream dispatch logic. Any RBAC,
   * localization, or preference checks are performed before record creation.
   * If successful, the full notification record (including actual sent/failed
   * state and unique notification ID) is returned.
   *
   * Error handling includes validation errors (400), permission denied (403),
   * or references to non-existent user/channel/template (404/409).
   *
   * @param body Notification event details to create, including recipient,
   *   channel, delivery type, status, and template used.

   * include user, channel, template type, delivery status, and date range for

  /**
   * Get a single notification by ID (NotificationLocalization.notifications).
   *
   * This API operation retrieves the full record of a specific notification
   * using its unique ID from the notifications table. Each notification entry
   * contains references to the recipient user, associated channel, template,
   * detailed delivery status, type (email, push, SMS), and full-rendered
   * payload as sent to the user. The retrieval ensures auditability and
   * compliance by providing complete delivery tracing, including possible

   * only authorized stakeholders (recipient, admin, compliance auditor) may
   * access this record.
   *

   * before allowing sensitive PII or message content to be returned. All
   * access is audit-logged for compliance. The operation is commonly used in
   * combination with notification listing and debugging workflows.
   *
   * Returned data includes: user/channel/template references, exact payload,
   * status, timestamps, and (optionally) a failure explanation. The API
   * responds with 404 if the notification is missing or deleted, and 403 for
   * insufficient permissions.

   * troubleshooting results. Full RBAC and permission checks are enforced;
   * end users generally cannot alter these records. All updates are

   * Validation ensures the notification exists, allowed fields are being
   * updated, immutable fields are protected, and audit policies are followed.
   * On success, the updated notification record is returned. On error, 400
   * (invalid data), 404 (not found), or 403 (forbidden) are returned.

   * action type, additional context, and timestamp. It serves as
   * legal/evidentiary proof of system actions and supports compliance
   * audits.
   *
   * Access is controlled by RBAC, typically restricted to system services,
   * admin, or back-office flows. Payload is validated for all required
   * fields. Once written, audit log entries are never changed or deleted
   * except for soft-delete by privileged compliance staff.
   *
   * Works alongside order status history, main order update endpoints, etc.
   * Error cases are invalid data, permission denied, or reference integrity
   * errors.

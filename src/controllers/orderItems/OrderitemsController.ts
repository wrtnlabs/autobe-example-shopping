   * Validates that the referenced order exists and is open for modification;
   * all business logic around inventory, pricing, order limits, and

   * reference, quantity, and any notes/status required. All actions are fully
   * audit-logged. Returns the created item with assigned ID and timestamps.

   * customer/admin operations. Business logic enforces search/filter on
   * fields like status (delivered, returned), product reference, order, and
   * time periods. Provides full audit compliance (shows only non-deleted
   * records unless permissions allow otherwise) and is optimized for both
   * admin and customer scenarios. Part of the full order/detail workflow for
   * UI integrations. Error cases for bad filters, bad input, or lack of
   * permission handled consistently. Response includes collection of order
   * item summaries and metadata for pagination and UI.

   * @param body Query parameters for order item searching, including paging
   *   and filters.

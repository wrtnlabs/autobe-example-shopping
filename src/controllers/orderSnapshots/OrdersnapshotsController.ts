   * rollback support, compliance evidence, and auditing.
   *
   * Access is restricted to authorized users with proper permissions (admin,

   * completeness; invalid or incomplete data will trigger error responses.
   * Snapshots can only be added, never updated in place (immutability).
   *
   * This API integrates with order update workflows and is logged for
   * compliance. Related APIs include order update, order status history, and
   * audit log endpoints.

   * List and search order snapshot records (CartOrder domain).

   * This endpoint returns a filtered and paginated list of order snapshot
   * records. Each snapshot is an immutable, serialized state of an order as
   * of a change event (placed, updated, completed, etc)â€”used for
   * rollback/reporting and auditability. Permits filtering by order, actor
   * (user/admin), timestamp ranges, and workflow context.

   * Security: RBAC and privacy masking to restrict access to only authorized
   * entities (e.g., customer, seller, or admin with proper permission).
   * Underlying audit history is not altered by reads.
   *
   * Use cases: Customer support, fraud audit, rollback after incident,
   * compliance reporting. Related: order/audit log endpoints for more atomic
   * reporting.
   *
   * Errors: Bad search parameters, permission or backend faults respond per
   * API error contracts.

   * intended for exceptional cases where an administrative correction is
   * necessary (e.g., to append missing audit context, not to edit order data
   * itself).

   * Access is strictly limited (e.g., senior admin or compliance officer) and
   * fully logged, including before/after data for rollback. All changes must
   * preserve proof of original state and may require secondary approval in
   * business logic. Attempts to update critical immutable fields (e.g.,
   * snapshot data) will be rejected.

   * to protected fields. Used sparingly in conjunction with the audit log
   * API.

   * Create a new order status history in the 'order_status_histories' table.
   *
   * This endpoint provides creation of a new order status history entry,
   * which is essential to maintain immutable audit trails of all order state
   * transitions, as specified in the 'Cart & Order' requirements section.
   * Each history entry references the order, actor (user/admin), and records
   * the state transition (from_status, to_status). Optional comments can be
   * used to provide context for status changes (e.g., auto-cancel, admin
   * override). All entries must capture the creation timestamp and are never
   * deleted but may be soft-deleted for audit compliance. Validation ensures
   * referenced order and user exist; non-existent IDs result in a 404 error.
   * Related operations: retrieving order status history, updating (for
   * comment corrections), and soft-deleting for privacy control.
   *
   * @param body Information required for creating an order status history
   *   entry, such as order_id, actor_id, from_status, to_status, comment, and
   *   created_at.

   * optional memo, as well as initial status and payment details. The
   * endpoint enforces business logic for inventory, pricing, anti-fraud (on
   * create), and audit logging (who, what, when). Compliance checks include
   * validating required business and regulatory fields (e.g., order number
   * uniqueness, channel). Errors are returned for failed validation,
   * integrity constraints, or business rule violations. Processing is
   * atomic—no partial creates—and all actions are thoroughly audit-logged.

   * Retrieve a paginated, filterable list of orders (Prisma: orders table).
   *
   * This endpoint enables clients to search and retrieve a paginated list of
   * orders from the system, supporting advanced queries with filtering and
   * sorting (by status, date, channel, user, etc.). It draws directly on the
   * Orders table, including only those records not marked as soft-deleted
   * (`deleted_at`). Security and permissions are enforced based on user
   * role—admins may access all, customers only their own. Input validation
   * ensures query parameters are well-formed, and business logic ensures
   * legal compliance for data retention and audit logging. Used in
   * combination with detail endpoints for full management workflows. Errors
   * for invalid filters, unauthorized access, or server/database errors are
   * handled with structured responses. This endpoint is typically paired with
   * the order detail, create, and update endpoints for full lifecycle
   * management. Returns a standardized paged order response including summary
   * properties and pagination metadata for UI/analytics use.
   *
   * @param body Query parameters for searching and paginating orders,
   *   including filters, search, page, and sort info.

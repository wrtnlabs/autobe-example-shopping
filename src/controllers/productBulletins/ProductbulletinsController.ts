   * Create a new product bulletin post (product_bulletins table, Engagement

   *
   * This endpoint enables an authorized user (typically product seller or
   * site admin) to create a new product bulletin post associated with a given
   * product. It inserts a record into the 'product_bulletins' table,
   * requiring all necessary fields (product_id, author_id, title, body). If
   * the actor is a moderator/admin, the bulletin may be marked as pinned or
   * visible only to staff/draft, depending on business requirements.
   *
   * Upon successful creation, the endpoint returns the full product bulletin
   * post, complete with post ID, timestamps, and all entered information.
   * Related business workflows (such as notifying subscribers, product
   * followers, or triggering moderation hooks) are possible via event hooks.
   * This endpoint works alongside listing (PATCH), reading (GET), updating
   * (PUT), and deleting (DELETE) endpoints for the product bulletin
   * lifecycle.
   *
   * @param body Information required to create a product bulletin post:
   *   product ID, author ID (inferred from session), title, body, status,
   *   etc.

  /**
   * Get a paginated and filtered list of product bulletin posts
   * (product_bulletins table, Engagement Boards).
   *
   * This endpoint retrieves a paginated and filtered list of product bulletin
   * posts from the 'product_bulletins' table, supporting full search and
   * administrative review workflows. The endpoint handles complex queries by
   * accepting a PATCH request with filtering criteria, such as keyword
   * searches, product IDs, author filtration, created_at date ranges, or
   * content status (published/deleted/pending). This ensures flexibility for
   * admin dashboards, product page boards, or public query tools.
   *
   * Advanced usage may allow staff/moderators to include soft-deleted posts
   * or draft bulletins by permission. Endpoints must validate query
   * parameters against RBAC rules for visibility (i.e., regular users see
   * public/published only, moderators see all).
   *
   * This API is to be used in conjunction with GET (read a single), POST
   * (create), PUT (update), and DELETE (remove/soft-delete) for full CRUD
   * lifecycle coverage. Audit logging of all accesses is strongly recommended
   * for compliance and operational transparency.
   *
   * @param body Filtering and pagination information for bulletin search.

   *
   * This API retrieves the full detail of a single product bulletin post. It

   * (a UUID). If the post exists and the requesting user has the necessary
   * permissions (public for published, staff/admin can view deleted/drafts),

   * in the 'product_bulletins' table and updates the audit timestamp.

   * properties (e.g., only admins can pin posts, regular authors cannot
   * change published/deleted status arbitrarily). The entire change is logged

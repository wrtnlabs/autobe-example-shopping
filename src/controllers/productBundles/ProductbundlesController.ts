   * as an atomic record in the 'product_bundles' table. The API checks all
   * input references for existence (product ID, variant ID), ensures

   * limited to single bundle creation.

   * Returned value is the newly-built bundle record, suitable for immediate
   * use in merchandising, analytics, or order logic. Permissions are checked
   * for admin/seller (deny on insufficient rights). On error, supplies
   * invalid reference, duplication, or permission error codes. This record
   * serves as the anchor for related downstream attachments—it never includes
   * nested detail, only references and atomic values.

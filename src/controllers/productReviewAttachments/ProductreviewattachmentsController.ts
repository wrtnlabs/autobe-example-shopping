   * Create a new product review attachment
   * (EngagementBoards.product_review_attachments).
   *
   * This operation allows a user (typically the review author, or a
   * moderator/admin) to add a media/attachment to an existing product review.
   * The request body must specify the review_id (which review to attach),
   * attachment_id (the uploaded media/attachment), and the sequence/order in
   * which this attachment should appear in the review.
   *
   * On creation, this endpoint checks:
   *
   * - Review_id references a valid, non-deleted product review that accepts
   *   attachments.
   * - Attachment_id references an existing, active attachment in the
   *   attachments table.
   * - User permissions: Only review authors (or privileged moderators/admins)
   *   may attach files to reviews.
   * - Business logic: sequence must be a non-negative integer and not duplicate
   *   within the same review.
   *
   * This action is logged for audit/compliance. It supports moderation and
   * content review features. Errors include validation of reference
   * integrity, permission checks, and attachment/media support (MIME
   * types/size limits enforced externally).
   *
   * It can be composed with review creation/edit APIs and media upload APIs.
   *
   * @param body Attachment creation payload: review_id, attachment_id,
   *   sequence.

   * Search/list product review attachments (media/files for product_reviews)

   * This endpoint allows clients (typically admin or moderator interfaces, or
   * review display widgets) to fetch a filtered, paginated list of product
   * review attachments, using criteria such as review ID, media/attachment
   * type, sequence/order, and optionally author or status. The response

   * from the 'product_review_attachments' and 'attachments' tables.
   *
   * Permissions are enforced: deleted reviews' attachments are only listed
   * for staff/moderators; public endpoints only show active, published
   * attachments. Audit/compliance logging must be in place for this endpoint,
   * particularly around export/bulk access. Pagination enables scalable
   * listing for reviews with many attachments.

   * Retrieve metadata and attachment info for a single product review

   * This operation retrieves detailed information about a specific product
   * review attachment. Product review attachments are used to link media
   * files (images, videos, documents) with product reviews. According to the
   * EngagementBoards schema, each product_review_attachment row consists of a
   * review_id (referring to product_reviews), an attachment_id (referring to
   * attachments), and a sequence (to control ordering).

   * which review and attachment instance this belongs to. This supports
   * product moderation, user content management, and display of review media
   * in the correct order. Only authorized users, moderators, or the review's
   * author can fetch full metadata, as review media may be subject to
   * moderation, soft deletion, or access controls.

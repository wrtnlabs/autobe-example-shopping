   * Create a new product review (product_reviews table, including

   *
   * Enables an authenticated user (usually verified buyer) to submit a new
   * review for a product, or for a specific product snapshot in the case of
   * versioned products. The endpoint accepts required fields such as product
   * ID, product_snapshot ID (if present/applicable), author ID (from
   * session), rating, title (optional), review body, and any moderation
   * flagging.
   *
   * Business logic ensures only one review per product/snapshot per user, and
   * enforces anti-abuse/fraud detection as outlined in the requirements
   * (possibly integrating with AI/fraud modules). Successful creation returns
   * the full review record.
   *
   * This endpoint is a critical part of the engagement lifecycle for
   * products, complimented by PATCH (list/search), GET (detail), PUT
   * (update), and DELETE (soft-delete) endpoints. All review creation events
   * are logged for audit/compliance reporting.
   *
   * @param body All required information to create a product review,
   *   including snapshot reference, author, rating, and content.

  /**
   * List and search product reviews (product_reviews table) with filtering
   * and pagination.
   *
   * This API provides an advanced product review listing and search function
   * for the 'product_reviews' table. Clients may request reviews by product
   * ID, snapshot ID (for immutable product version linkage), author, star
   * rating, creation date, or moderation status. The endpoint is used for
   * product page review lists, admin/moderation dashboards, and search
   * interfaces. For administrators/moderators, additional filters may be
   * exposed (e.g., to include soft-deleted or flagged reviews).
   *
   * Pagination and sorting (by date/rating) are supported in the request body
   * to handle large review sets. Standard RBAC is enforced to ensure regular
   * users only see published/non-deleted, verified reviews as appropriate,
   * while privileged users can see all for moderation. The endpoint is fully
   * auditable and allows integration with GET (retrieve single), POST
   * (create), PUT (update), and DELETE (soft-delete) endpoints for full
   * product review lifecycle management.
   *
   * @param body Filter/search options for product reviews, including product
   *   ID, snapshot, author, rating, moderation status, pagination, etc.

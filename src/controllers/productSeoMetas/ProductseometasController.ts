   *
   * Updates details of an existing product SEO meta entry, leveraging atomic

   * update operation requires the unique identifier of the SEO meta (id) and
   * allows modification of properties such as meta_title, meta_description,
   * or meta_keywords. The operation enforces strict audit logging for all
   * changes, updating the 'updated_at' field, and ensuring that only
   * authorized users with suitable permissions may perform updates.
   *
   * Security considerations include RBAC enforcement so only permitted users
   * (typically admins and channel managers) may update SEO metadata. The
   * operation must validate that updates do not violate uniqueness
   * constraints (no duplicate SEO meta per product and channel) and must
   * respect soft deletion fields.
   *
   * Related read and delete operations are available for viewing and
   * soft-deleting SEO meta records for the same entity. If the entity is soft
   * deleted, it must not be possible (or must throw a suitable error) to
   * update it unless restored. Validation includes checks for existence,
   * permission, and validation of data length and structure (e.g., maximum
   * length of meta fields). Errors return a suitable error code and message,
   * such as not found or forbidden.

   * regulatory audit, rollback, and legal retention. Only authorized users

   * logs but ensures the deleted record cannot be used for further SEO
   * queries or updates until restored.

   * traceability of all deletion actions. Restoration or view operations of
   * soft-deleted entries are possible through other endpoints as required.

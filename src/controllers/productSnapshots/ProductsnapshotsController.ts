  /**
   * Get a specific product snapshot (`product_snapshots` table) by ID for

   *
   * This API is used to fetch a single product snapshot by its ID, which is
   * an immutable version of product information, used for audit trails and
   * rollback features per Product Domain requirements (see Prisma:
   * product_snapshots). It returns all snapshot metadata, editor references,
   * and version details. Only authorized users (based on roles/RBAC) can
   * access a snapshot. Snapshots are never edited after creation, ensuring
   * compliance with audit immutability. If the snapshot does not exist or
   * permission is denied, a 404 or 403 error is returned respectively. This
   * endpoint is vital for e-commerce auditing and historical UI
   * reconstruction, supporting features like product history, reversal, legal
   * compliance, and analytics. Integrated with user activity logging for full
   * traceability.

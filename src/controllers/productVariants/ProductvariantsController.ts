   * Create new product variant for a product ('product_variants' table).

   * product variant (e.g., size, color, edition) attached to an existing
   * product, persisting a new row in the 'product_variants' table. The
   * request must pass input validation, ensuring uniqueness of code and
   * validity of parent product ID. Attaches initial meta (timestamps, active
   * flags) and does not include downstream option/attribute data—all such
   * configuration is managed through additional endpoints.
   *
   * After creation, a success response includes the atomic fields for the
   * variant, ready for downstream assignment of options/attributes. Error
   * cases include product not found, code conflicts, permission/authorization
   * failures, or invalid foreign references. An audit log and variant
   * snapshot should be produced as part of the operation.

   * @param body Payload for creating product variant: parent product, unique
   *   code, atomic fields.

  /**
   * List product variants with search, filtering, and pagination
   * ('product_variants' table).
   *
   * This endpoint returns a paginated set of product variants from the
   * 'product_variants' table, allowing clients to apply search, filtering,
   * and ordering. Filters can include product ID (to find variants for a
   * given product), date range selection (created_at, updated_at), and
   * pattern search for code or label (with GIN/trgm support). The operation
   * ensures that only non-deleted (deleted_at is null) variants are returned,
   * complying with business visibility and audit policies.
   *
   * Pagination meta (total count, pages, etc.) must be included in the
   * response. Security checks restrict access to authenticated users (scope
   * as required: admin, seller). Joins to related atomic fields (product
   * code, base info) may be available in summary mode but never include
   * redundant or deeply nested objects. Error handling covers permission
   * violation, invalid filters, and out-of-range pagination requests. This
   * endpoint is typically combined with single-variant get/post/put/delete
   * endpoints for detailed operations.
   *
   * @param body Parameters for variant list query: filters (product, code),
   *   page/size, search terms.

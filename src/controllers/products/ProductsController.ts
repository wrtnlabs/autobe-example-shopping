   * Create new product in shopping mall ('products' table).
   *
   * This operation creates a new product in the shopping mall, allowing
   * sellers or admins to insert a new product record into the 'products'
   * table.
   *
   * On invocation, the endpoint expects a complete product descriptor that
   * includes the product's unique code (scoped to the channel), channel
   * reference, and any basic information required for first registration
   * (e.g., creation timestamp, name, and optional initial associations if
   * supported). The process verifies channel membership and product code
   * uniqueness to preserve business integrity. The request strictly disallows
   * redundant data—only atomic product identification and foreign keys are
   * permitted; all detailed attributes (variants, media, SEO, descriptions,
   * etc.) must be managed in related downstream endpoints.
   *
   * Upon success, the endpoint should trigger post-processing: generation of
   * an initial product snapshot (immutable record of product state at
   * creation), audit log entry for compliance, and optional event
   * notification for admin/seller dashboards. Error handling includes code
   * conflicts, invalid channel reference, and permission-denied failures. The
   * endpoint is secured for authenticated, properly-permissioned users
   * (admin/seller roles) and returns the created product object with its ID
   * and metadata for further downstream operations.
   *
   * @param body Complete atomic product creation payload. Includes unique
   *   code, channel reference, and normal product fields.

   * (admins/sellers with permission) to patch atomic product fields, such as
   * code, administrative flags, or relationships, except for
   * business-limiting keys such as deleted_at (which is handled by the delete
   * endpoint).
   *
   * The process first validates product existence and
   * authentication/authorization of the requester. It applies uniqueness
   * checks (e.g., updated product code must remain unique within the channel)
   * and ensures no redundant or derived fields are accepted. On successful
   * update, the service must generate a new immutable product snapshot (for
   * audit and rollback) and update audit logs accordingly.
   *
   * Error responses include not-found, code conflict, permission failure, and
   * business-rule violations. Transactionality is enforced to avoid partial
   * updates. Returns updated product with metadata; does not include
   * downstream related resource modifications (handled by their specific
   * endpoints).

   * state, and updates the deleted_at timestamp.

   * audit/history/legal compliance), updates audit logs, and typically
   * initiates removal from downstream references (e.g., active catalog

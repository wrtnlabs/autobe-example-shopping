   * Assign a role and permission to a user by creating an RBAC assignment.
   *
   * This endpoint creates a new RBAC assignment for a user, role, and
   * permission mapping in the system RBAC model (as reflected in the
   * 'rbac_assignments' table). On POST, it validates the atomic assignment
   * fields (including user_id, role_id, permission_id, and optional
   * scoping/expiry), ensuring that no duplicate exists for the same
   * combination.
   *
   * Assignment creation is admin-restricted as it can alter permissions and
   * escalate access. All actions are logged in the audit log for
   * traceability, which is essential for rollback or investigating incidents.
   * If any of the provided IDs do not exist or violate constraints (e.g.,
   * role/permission not found), a validation or not-found error is returned.
   * Success returns the full newly created assignment record.
   *
   * Edge cases: Duplicate assignments (same user/role/permission/context)
   * result in a conflict error. Only users with explicit admin/RBAC
   * assignment rights may use this endpoint. Assignment creation is fully
   * auditable and supports compliance needs.
   *
   * @param body RBAC assignment creation payload, aligning with
   *   IRbacAssignment.ICreate (user_id, role_id, permission_id,
   *   channel/section scope, expiry).

  /**
   * Retrieve a filtered, paginated list of RBAC assignments.
   *
   * This list endpoint retrieves RBAC assignments from the 'rbac_assignments'
   * table, supporting advanced filtering, searching by user_id, role_id,
   * permission_id, channel/section scope, or expiry. The endpoint is meant
   * for admin/operations teams managing access control: search is specified
   * via a request body, with pagination and sorting options included (e.g.,
   * per page, offset, sort by created_at, etc).
   *
   * For each assignment returned, the fields include references to user ID,
   * role ID, permission ID, and their scoping/expiry information as per the
   * table schema. The endpoint never includes denormalized related entity
   * details—those should be queried separately. Only users with explicit
   * admin/RBAC audit rights may access this list.
   *
   * Edge cases: If no assignments match the filters, returns an empty result
   * with proper pagination meta. Request body structure must match
   * IRbacAssignment.IRequestSearch. The endpoint is fully auditable—every
   * access is logged for compliance.
   *
   * @param body Search and pagination filters for RBAC assignment list,
   *   matching IRbacAssignment.IRequestSearch data structure.

   * Create a new RBAC permission in the rbac_permissions table.
   *
   * This endpoint is used to create a new RBAC permission entity, mapping
   * directly to the 'rbac_permissions' table in the database, enforcing
   * fine-grained system or custom permissions for role-based access control
   * (RBAC).
   *
   * Upon receiving a POST request, the system validates the provided
   * permission code (ensuring uniqueness) and captures additional fields such
   * as description and is_builtin (to differentiate system vs admin-defined
   * roles). Only authorized admin users are permitted to call this
   * endpointâ€”as permission creation can impact overall system security. The
   * system audits this action by recording the creator and timestamp for
   * compliance and rollback.
   *
   * Field validation ensures that permissions are atomic, do not duplicate
   * existing values, and link only by reference (not denormalized) to
   * assignments. Attempting to add a duplicate code will trigger a conflict
   * error, while missing/invalid data results in a validation error. On
   * success, the endpoint returns the created permission object.
   *
   * @param body RBAC permission creation payload, matching rbac_permissions
   *   schema. Must include required fields: code (string, unique),
   *   description (optional), is_builtin (bool).

  /**
   * Update an RBAC permission by ID in the rbac_permissions table.
   *
   * This endpoint allows updates to an existing RBAC permission identified by
   * its unique ID. All fields, including code, description, and is_builtin
   * can be updated according to authorization policies (e.g., only system
   * users can update code/is_builtin fields). Every update is audit-logged
   * with both the original and new data for compliance traceability.

   * or cross-entity changes. If an update attempts to change a permission
   * code to a value already in use, a conflict error is returned. If the
   * specified permission does not exist, a not-found error results. Robust

   * permission schema. This operation is critical for evolving system role
   * and permission management under RBAC.

   * compliance and troubleshooting.

  /**
   * Logically delete (soft delete) an RBAC permission by ID.
   *
   * This endpoint allows for the logical (soft) deletion of an RBAC
   * permission entry, strictly following the soft delete policy (deleted_at
   * timestamp) for compliance and auditing. It does not physically remove the
   * record, maintaining the ability to audit or restore permissions if
   * necessary.
   *
   * Authorized system/admin users must provide the permission's unique ID.
   * Before marking the permission as deleted, the endpoint checks whether the
   * permission exists and whether it is currently assigned to any roles. If
   * assigned, it may block the deletion or require force confirmation,
   * depending on business rules (e.g., cannot delete active permissions).
   *
   * All deletion attempts and outcomes, including errors like not-found or
   * assignment-in-use, are audit-logged for compliance. Successful soft

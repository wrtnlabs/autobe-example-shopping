   * Create a new refund (refunds table).
   *
   * This API allows for the creation of a new refund record. The client
   * submits refund details such as user reference, amount, refund method,
   * status, legal region, and relevant timestamps (creation, update). Upon
   * request validation, a new entry is persisted in the 'refunds' table and
   * additional business logic may trigger notifications, audit log entries,
   * or compliance workflows (e.g., regulatory export).
   *
   * The API is critical for finance/admin operations, auto-refund logic, or
   * user self-service initiations (if policy permits). RBAC and business
   * rules should control which actors or roles can submit refunds,
   * particularly for sensitive methods (e.g., bank/cash). After creation, the
   * full refund object—including its assigned ID and initial status—is
   * returned in the response.
   *
   * Errors: validation errors for malformed inputs, 403 for lacking
   * permission, and compliance-triggered rejections such as policy locks or
   * suspicious triggers requiring escalation.
   *
   * Dependent flows may include automatic notification to users/admins or
   * scheduled export to accounting systems.
   *
   * @param body Refund creation data (user, amount, method, etc).

  /**
   * Search and list paginated refunds (refunds table).
   *
   * This API returns a paginated, filtered list of refund records from the
   * 'refunds' database table. It is designed for administrators, support
   * staff, or finance dashboard users to search for refunds by user, refund
   * method, status, region, time windows, and other compliance or
   * business-related filters.
   *
   * Supports robust pagination and sorting for efficient querying of large
   * histories, helping with regulatory reporting, business reconciliation,
   * and end-user support scenarios.
   *
   * All query parameters are managed through the request body object,
   * enabling extensible future filters (status, region, time, amount, etc.).
   * This list endpoint does not expose any user PII directly but returns
   * references so users with sufficient permissions can navigate to refund
   * details.
   *
   * This API should have strict RBAC: only staff with the appropriate
   * permission (e.g., 'manage_refunds') can fetch all records; users may be
   * scoped only to their own refunds unless elevated. Related endpoints
   * include single refund retrieval, refund creation, and refund update.
   *
   * Error handling includes validation errors for invalid query parameters
   * and permission-related errors where appropriate.
   *
   * @param body Refund search filters, pagination, and sorting options.

   * Get full details of a refund by ID (refunds table).

   * Enables authorized staff (admin/Finance) to update a refund record
   * identified by its unique ID. Fields eligible for update include status,
   * updated amount, legal region, method, etc., as permitted by business
   * rules and workflow state. Each update is audit-logged to fulfill
   * compliance/auditability.
   *
   * This endpoint ensures robust control over refund management, typically
   * for workflow progress (approval, completed, failed, reversed) and error
   * correction. Only users with sufficient permission (e.g., staff in refund
   * processing roles) can execute updates. The updated refund object is
   * returned upon success.
   *
   * The operation must respect regulatory policies (immutable fields,
   * rollback protection); attempts to update locked/refused refunds return
   * business logic errors. 404 is returned for nonexistent IDs. If the refund
   * is soft-deleted (deleted_at set), most updates are prohibited except for
   * restoration with appropriate permissions.

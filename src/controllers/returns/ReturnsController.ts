   * Create a new product return for an order item.

   * This operation registers a new return for a specific purchased order
   * item. The request includes required details such as order_item_id,
   * user_id (as initiator), return reason, and any supporting information for
   * after-sales processing. The table models each return as an atomic,
   * auditable event, which then participates in system workflows (approval,
   * refund, analysis).
   *
   * Validation: Input checks ensure the order item is eligible for return,
   * not already returned/exchanged, and supplied information is complete.
   * Permissions: Customers can generally initiate their own returns;
   * sellers/admins may act for escalations with proper authorization; all
   * actions are audit-logged.
   *
   * Related: Status change/update is managed by separate endpoints. Once
   * created, the return participates in tracked after-sales workflow.
   *
   * Errors: Business logic errors (ineligible for return), missing/invalid
   * IDs, or permission failures trigger standardized API errors.
   *
   * @param body New return registration (order item, user, reason, etc.).

   * Retrieve a paginated and filtered list of product return records.

   * ranges, or reason substrings.

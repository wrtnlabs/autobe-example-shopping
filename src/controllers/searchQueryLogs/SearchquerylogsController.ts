   * This endpoint receives data on a search event (as performed by a user or
   * system module) and persists a new search query log entry in the
   * 'search_query_logs' database table. The POST body requires essential
   * event details: the search query as plain text, associated
   * language/locale, (optionally) a JSON-encoded string describing
   * filters/facets, result count returned, and if available, the user’s
   * unique identifier. Strict input validation ensures all mandatory fields
   * (query, language, result_count, created_at) are present and type-safe.
   *
   * The operation is subject to RBAC: only trusted internal subsystems or
   * users with 'log:write' or analytics-write permission may call this
   * endpoint, maintaining legal and business compliance. Write attempts
   * involving invalid data or unauthorized requesters are rejected (400,
   * 403). When storing user-linked search activity, all PII and sensitive
   * content must be pre-processed or redacted as per privacy policy.
   *
   * @param body A new search event's log details, including query, language,
   *   filters, result count, and optional user reference.

  /**
   * Retrieve a paginated, filterable list of search query log entries from
   * search_query_logs table.
   *
   * This endpoint provides a comprehensive, paginated, and filterable listing
   * interface for search query logs, supporting advanced analytics,
   * compliance examination, and large-scale audit scenarios. The underlying
   * Prisma table 'search_query_logs' is designed to record every individual
   * search event (from user or system), including query term, applied
   * filters, detected language, user reference (optional), and the result
   * count returned. All columns are fully atomic for third normal form, and
   * denormalization for aggregate reporting is kept external to this table.
   *
   * Access to the `/searchQueryLogs` PATCH endpoint is restricted to users
   * and admins with explicit permission for analytics/reporting as the log
   * data may include privacy-sensitive user actions or internal system
   * queries. Clients typically supply a JSON request body with filters—such
   * as by date range, language, query text, or min/max result count—for
   * audit, security review, or dashboard rendering. Sorting (by recency,
   * relevance, or volume) and pagination are enforced by parameters in the
   * request body to ensure scalable and efficient querying.
   *
   * If the system is configured for multi-tenant operation, additional
   * filters may enforce that only logs from the requesting user or accessible
   * tenants are included. Operational errors (e.g., invalid filter, malformed
   * date, or missing mandatory pagination info) return a 400 error.
   * Unauthorized access (missing permissions) returns 403. Search queries are
   * never deleted directly to support audit and compliance unless explicitly
   * purged for legal reasons.
   *
   * @param body Filtering, sorting, and pagination options for search query
   *   log list retrieval.

   *
   * GET /searchQueryLogs/{id} retrieves all stored details for one search
   * query log entry, precisely as stored in the search_query_logs database
   * table. This table is purpose-built for the AI Shopping Mall’s analytics
   * and compliance needs, capturing per-event search actions by users or the
   * system itself. The entry includes the plain-text query, language code
   * (for i18n or localization), filter details (e.g. category, price, etc,
   * stored as JSON string), a reference to user if authenticated (may be
   * null), and the integer result count.
   *
   * Access to the detail endpoint is restricted to analytics-enabled users,
   * admins, or users accessing their own records per RBAC rules. The API
   * performs input validation on UUID (returns 400 on error) and checks
   * record existence (404 if absent). Upon success, all data fields
   * (including metadata) are returned for display, audit, or analyst review.

   * (logical remove), providing complete auditability and error traceability
   * on search behaviors.

   * This endpoint provides secure, full update capability of an individual

   * correcting a logged search (e.g., retroactive filter updates, amending
   * misrecorded language code, or appending a compliance annotation/tag) or
   * updating user attribution after a merger of accounts. Input is strictly
   * validated and type-safe: only all required fields in the request body

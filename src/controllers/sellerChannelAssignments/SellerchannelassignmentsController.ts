   * body includes seller_id, channel_id, and assigned_at (timestamp of
   * assignment). It enforces uniqueness constraint (no duplicate
   * seller/channel pairs) and triggers any business logic (e.g., onboarding
   * notifications or compliance audits). Only admins with appropriate channel
   * management permissions may use this endpoint.
   *
   * If the combination already exists and is active, a 409 Conflict is
   * returned. Newly created assignments include all link metadata. Supports
   * full onboarding and channel management flows requiring dynamic access to
   * channels.
   *
   * @param body Data to link a seller to a channel; includes IDs and
   *   assigned_at timestamp.

   * List/search seller_channel_assignments (seller_channel_assignments table,

   *
   * This API endpoint returns a paginated list of seller_channel_assignments,
   * as implemented in the seller_channel_assignments table. Its main purpose
   * is to supply admin users, onboarding systems, and review/audit processes
   * with a filtered list of seller-to-channel assignments, including
   * assignment and revocation info. Supports filtering by seller_id,
   * channel_id, dates, and search keywords; includes pagination controls
   * (page, pageSize, sort order). The response structure contains both the
   * list of assignments and pagination metadata (total count, current page,
   * etc).
   *
   * Security: Only accessible to users with suitable admin privileges or
   * channel management rights. Data includes assigned_at/revoked_at, linked
   * seller/channel IDs, and may be cross-joined to fetch
   * conversation-friendly display (seller nickname, channel name).
   *
   * This operation aligns with onboarding flows, channel assignment
   * management, and compliance reviews, as detailed in system requirements.
   * Useful for developing dashboards or analytics around channel-seller
   * mapping. Errors are returned for invalid paging or access.
   *
   * @param body Query object specifying filter, search, and pagination for
   *   seller_channel_assignments.

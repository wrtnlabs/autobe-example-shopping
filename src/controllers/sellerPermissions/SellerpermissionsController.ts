   * Create a new seller_permission in the seller_permissions table.
   *
   * This API allows admins to create and assign a permission
   * (permission_code) to a seller, as described by the seller_permissions
   * Prisma schema table. The endpoint receives a validated request body with
   * all required attributes—specifically, seller_id, granted_by_admin_id,
   * permission_code, and granted_at. Expires_at may be provided for temporary
   * permissions.
   *
   * Enforcement of business rules includes: Preventing duplicate
   * permission_code assignments to the same seller, honoring the unique
   * constraint. Validating that the granting admin has the privilege to grant
   * the requested permission. Ensuring auditability by logging the creation
   * event, as per compliance.
   *
   * If a permission assignment already exists for the seller and
   * permission_code combination, a suitable error (409 Conflict) is returned.
   * Only users with admin rights are allowed to use this endpoint, checked
   * via RBAC.
   *
   * This endpoint ties directly into seller onboarding, RBAC assignment
   * flows, and administrative audit trails, as described in seller management
   * system requirements.
   *
   * @param body Information for creating a new seller_permission assignment,
   *   linking a seller, an admin (granter), and a permission_code. Required
   *   for onboarding/escalation.

   * masked or limited per context. Pagination meta and result records are
   * included in the response, and only atomic seller_permission attributes
   * (no PII/contextual RBAC state) are returned. Access/changes are
   * audit-logged.

  /**
   * Get a single seller_permission (seller_permissions table) by ID.
   *
   * This API operation retrieves the details of a single seller_permission
   * entity, as defined in the seller_permissions Prisma schema model. The
   * purpose is to allow administrators or system reviewers to fetch the
   * direct permission assignment between a seller and a granted
   * role/permission. Every column from the table is included—such as id,
   * seller_id, granted_by_admin_id, permission_code, granted_at,
   * expires_at—with relationships resolved for contextual display (e.g.,
   * augmenting with seller nickname or granting admin username in response,
   * if needed).
   *
   * Security considerations include: Only users with appropriate admin
   * privileges or RBAC permissions may access sensitive permission records,
   * especially those assigned to high-privilege sellers. All accesses are
   * logged for audit, and soft deletion (deleted_at) is respected. If a
   * seller_permission is not found or is soft-deleted and the actor does not
   * have permission to view deleted records, a 404 is returned.
   *
   * Because seller_permissions are part of compliance and escalated access
   * reviews, additional API operations to list all permissions, assign/remove
   * permissions, or filter by roles/channel/context may be needed in the
   * overall API.
   *
   * Error handling includes proper 404 for not found, and 403 for
   * insufficient permissions. The API relates to onboarding, RBAC, and
   * compliance admin flows, where managing and tracking permissions is
   * crucial.
   *
   * When using this endpoint, consumers should also be aware that detailed
   * permission configuration and role/permission explanations can be found
   * via related endpoints for admin_permissions and seller_profiles, tying
   * the results into the system's full RBAC matrix.
   *
   * @param id The unique identifier for the target seller_permission.

  /**
   * Update an existing seller_permission record by ID (seller_permissions

   *
   * This API endpoint enables updating selected fields of a seller_permission
   * record, as outlined in the seller_permissions Prisma schema. Attribute
   * updates might include changing the permission_code, extending or changing
   * expires_at, or correcting a granted_by_admin_id field (where system
   * policy permits). All edits are strictly audited for traceability, meeting
   * compliance and history requirements. Atomic updates only; no bulk or

   * except by privileged users for restoration/reversal purposes.
   *

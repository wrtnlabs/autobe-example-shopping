   * checks). Input must include valid seller_id, verification type (e.g.,
   * KYC), and any optional external references or notes. Upon success, the
   * new verification status is set (typically pending) and can be advanced
   * using dedicated status/advance endpoints elsewhere. Creation is fully
   * validated for linkage and business rules, and audit-trace is recorded.
   * RBAC checks: only the seller or authorized admin/staff can create. Errors
   * returned for invalid or duplicate creation, or forbidden actions.

   * required attributes such as user_id, nickname, status, plus optional
   * fields per onboarding flow. On success, the new seller is registered,
   * their status set as per the input, and RBAC/permission escalation flows
   * can be triggered externally. Input is validated for duplicate user_id and

   * downstream workflow must invoke those APIs if needed. Errors on duplicate
   * user_id or data validation violation are clearly surfaced in response.

   * assignment, and free-text search (nickname, email). Pagination, sorting
   * direction (asc/desc), and optional export features (bulk download) are

   * policy. API output is a page object including meta (total count,

   * fields (no PII/leaked RBAC state). May be composed with additional filter
   * options for advanced enterprise or BI use cases.

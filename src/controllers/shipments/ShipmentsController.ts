   * creation for an order). Errors for missing required references or invalid

   * process for orders and include references to the order, actor
   * (shipper/fulfiller/admin), carrier, tracking number, and status
   * (shipped/in-transit/delivered/returned). Deletion is performed for
   * compliance or operational correctionâ€”underlying shipment data remains for

   * Permissions: Only users with relevant RBAC permissions (e.g., admin or

   * Related endpoints: Detailed shipment information (GET /shipments/{id}),
   * creation/modification endpoints, and order fulfillment status change logs
   * all reference the same shipment entity.

   * Errors: Attempts to delete with insufficient permissions, or referencing
   * non-existent/invalid shipment ID, will return standardized errors as per
   * API policy.

   * of the previous or resulting state. Required by audit, rollback, and
   * legal compliance rules.
   *
   * Creation of snapshots should only be accessible to system-internal logic
   * or privileged actors. The request body must specify the entity type, id,
   * change type (create/update/delete), and optionally a reason. All snapshot
   * creation actions must be audit-logged with full timestamp and actor
   * traceability.
   *
   * Related endpoints: PATCH for search/list, GET for retrieval, PUT for
   * updating annotations or correcting metadata.
   *
   * @param body Snapshot creation data including entity type, id, change
   *   type, and reason.

   * This endpoint retrieves a paginated and filtered list of snapshot records
   * representing changes and versions across entities (e.g., product, order,
   * category, etc.). It is key to the system's compliance and audit-trail
   * features, allowing users or administrators to find historical changes by
   * entity type, entity id, date/time, actor, reason, or change type.
   *
   * Access to this endpoint is typically restricted to admin or privileged
   * users, with strong audit logging for access to potentially sensitive
   * history data.
   *
   * Typical related API operations include GET (retrieve specific snapshot by
   * id), POST (create snapshot for a change), and PUT (update a snapshot's
   * metadata, used for corrections/annotations).

   *
   * This API operation deletes a specific snapshot entry by marking its
   * deleted_at column (soft deletion), thereby preserving audit history
   * required by business and compliance. Snapshot records document the
   * immutable/point-in-time versions of various entities from core tables
   * (e.g., products, categories, boards). Deletion operations are restricted
   * to users with escalated permissions (admin, compliance officers),
   * ensuring that only those authorized for legal control can execute the
   * endpoint. The path parameter id is the UUID of the target snapshot.
   * Business logic may include verification that all references to the
   * snapshot are either not in use or appropriately redirected. After running
   * this operation, audit logs must be generated, and rollback can only be
   * performed by a separate restore flow. Error handling should address lost
   * references or attempts to delete an already-in-use or non-existent
   * snapshot. Related APIs: GET /snapshots/{id} for retrieval, PATCH
   * /snapshots for listing/search, POST /snapshots for creation.

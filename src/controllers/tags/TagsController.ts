   * (admin) and public-facing scenarios are supported, but access control may

   *
   * Request parameters allow specifying pagination (page, pageSize),
   * full-text search on tag code or name, ordering, and filtering by channel,
   * active status, or creation/update timelines. Results include total counts
   * and data arrays, following structured pagination. Business logic enforces

   * permissions, or server errors. The operation helps power product
   * categorization, search, and dynamic merchandising for end-users and
   * admins.

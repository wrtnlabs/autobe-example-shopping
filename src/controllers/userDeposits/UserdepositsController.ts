  /**
   * Create a new user deposit record (user_deposits table, PromotionsBalances
   * domain).
   *
   * This operation creates a new user deposit event. A deposit event
   * represents a one-time addition or reversal of funds to a user's deposit
   * balance, and is modeled in the user_deposits schema (see Prisma for
   * atomic event representation). The body must specify user_id, amount,
   * deposit_type (e.g., 'load', 'reversal', or 'adjustment'), status, and
   * currency. Business logic: Amount must be positive for 'load' and negative
   * for 'reversal'. The deposit event must be associated with a valid, active
   * user only.
   *
   * On execution, an audit log is inserted referencing the event for
   * compliance tracking. Soft deletes and state transitions do not apply
   * (those handled by timestamp and audit). Refund, admin credit and
   * regulatory reversal must each be distinguishable via type field. Balance
   * updates and downstream event triggers (notification, refunds system) are
   * handled asynchronously. Duplicate detection/duplicate transaction logic
   * should be applied to prevent accidental repeat entries.
   *
   * If the referenced user is deleted or suspended, deposits are rejected as
   * per regulatory logic. On success, the response returns the full deposit
   * row, including timestamps and all audit fields. Error cases: 400 for
   * validation error (amount/type/currency), 404 if user does not exist, 403
   * if state does not allow deposit event.
   *
   * @param body Deposit creation payload, see IUsersDeposit.ICreate.

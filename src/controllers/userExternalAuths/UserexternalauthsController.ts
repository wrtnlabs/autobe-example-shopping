   * matching the 'IUserExternalAuth.ICreate' schema, validating that the
   * provider and external_user_id are not already linked to another account.

   * privileged flows can invoke this operation (e.g., user self-linking with
   * proper verification, admin linking, or system-provisioned integrations).
   * The operation is part of the lifecycle covering onboarding, account
   * linking, and external access provisioning, as referenced in 'User
   * Architecture' and Prisma schema comments. Errors are returned for
   * duplicate mapping attempts or validation failures.

  /**
   * Get a paginated/searchable list of userExternalAuths (external login

   *
   * This operation enables authorized staff (e.g., admins) to retrieve a
   * filtered, paginated list of external authentication mappings
   * (userExternalAuths) in the system. These records track how internal user
   * accounts are associated with external identities for SSO, OAuth, and
   * integrated platforms, as specified in the 'user_external_auths' table.
   * Each mapping captures the system user, provider code, and external
   * provider user ID, supporting unified authentication management and
   * regulatory auditability. Security is enforced via RBAC—access is limited
   * to roles with user-access management privileges. Many real-world flows
   * require paging, sorting, and full-text search (by provider,
   * external_user_id, or date ranges), all supported by this operation
   * following Prisma schema comments. Pagination is especially necessary for
   * large systems with thousands of external mappings. Errors (e.g., invalid
   * filters, denied access) are surfaced with clear error messages per system
   * API standard. Typically used alongside GET/POST/PUT/DELETE for
   * userExternalAuths management.

  /**
   * Retrieve a user profile by ID (user_profiles table).
   *
   * This API retrieves an individual user profile record as defined in the
   * user_profiles schema table. The user_profiles table contains extended
   * personal profile data linked 1:1 with users, including fields such as
   * display_name, legal_name (field-encrypted), birth_date (field-encrypted),
   * gender, locale, timezone, and marketing_opt_in for explicit consent
   * tracking as per GDPR/CCPA. Each profile change is audit-logged and tied
   * to compliance workflows. Access to PII is controlled by contextual RBAC
   * and all sensitive data is returned only to authorized actors; field-level
   * encryption/decryption is performed on profile read. If the requested
   * profile does not exist or the caller lacks appropriate permission, the
   * API returns a 404 or 403 with proper audit logging.
   *
   * Security considerations include strict RBAC enforcement and protection
   * against PII leaks. This operation is often paired with creation and
   * update endpoints to complete the CRUD lifecycle on user profile records.
   * The endpoint is used in both self-service profile access by end users and
   * administrative review cases. Errors relating to missing or restricted
   * profiles are returned with appropriate error codes and descriptions.

/**
 * Validate access controls on the abuse incident listing endpoint: ensure
 * non-admins cannot access sensitive event logs.
 *
 * This test simulates a request to the GET
 * /aimall-backend/administrator/abuseIncidents API while the API connection is
 * under the context of a non-admin userâ€”specifically, a typical unprivileged
 * customer or seller account (based on project credential context
 * availability).
 *
 * It then asserts that the API responds with a forbidden or access denied
 * error, never allowing non-admin users to view page data. This confirms that
 * backend ABAC restrictions protecting fraud/abuse logs are robustly enforced
 * at the route level for all unauthorized actors.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. (Prerequisite) Prepare a connection that simulates a typical non-admin user
 *    account.
 * 2. Attempt to request a list of abuse incident records using the non-admin
 *    connection.
 * 3. Assert that the API returns a forbidden/access denied error, and that no page
 *    data is exposed to the caller.

/**
 * Validate hard deletion of an attachment entity by admin.
 *
 * This test covers the permanent deletion (hard delete) of an attachment
 * record, identified by its unique attachmentId, by an administrator. The
 * business flow requires:
 *
 * 1. Creating a new post (parent entity to attach media)
 * 2. Uploading (creating) a new attachment for that post, thus getting its
 *    attachmentId
 * 3. Invoking DELETE /administrator/attachments/{attachmentId} as administrator â€”
 *    as per business rules, this operation should permanently remove the
 *    attachment record from the database's metadata table, and, by policy, may
 *    also trigger file storage cleanup and deletion event logging
 * 4. Verifying proper removal from the metadata: attempt to fetch the same
 *    attachmentId after deletion should result in a not-found error (for hard
 *    delete)
 *
 * Test steps:
 *
 * 1. Create a new post with valid random data via posts.create
 * 2. Upload a new attachment to the created post; assert metadata and extract its
 *    attachmentId
 * 3. Delete the attachment by id via attachments.erase (hard delete)
 * 4. (If fetch-by-id exists) Verify subsequent fetch by id yields not-found
 *    (throws error)

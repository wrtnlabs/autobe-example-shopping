/**
 * Validate denial of unauthorized access to the administrator attachment list
 * endpoint.
 *
 * Business context: The /aimall-backend/administrator/attachments endpoint
 * exposes potentially privacy-sensitive attachment metadata. Only administrator
 * (or properly authenticated) users should be permitted access. Unauthorized
 * users must never receive attachment lists or records via this route.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Attempt to invoke the endpoint without administrator authentication using an
 *    unauthenticated connection object.
 * 2. Assert that the API call throws a forbidden (403) or unauthorized (401) error
 *    (i.e., any errorâ€”do not attempt to pattern-match the error message).
 * 3. Assert that no attachment data is returned if error is thrown (i.e., error is
 *    thrown pre-result).
 * 4. If the call erroneously succeeds, the test must fail, as this is a
 *    significant security issue.

/**
 * Validate that deleting an audit log is forbidden for non-admin users.
 *
 * This test ensures audit log delete authorization works as expected by
 * attempting the following business flow:
 *
 * 1. As an admin, create an analytics dashboard (this triggers audit log
 *    generation for admin actions)
 * 2. Use the resulting dashboard's UUID as a stand-in auditLogId
 * 3. Simulate a non-admin user context by providing an invalid admin token
 * 4. Attempt to delete the audit log entry using the valid auditLogId
 * 5. Confirm that the request fails with an authorization error (should throw or
 *    return error due to insufficient privileges)
 *
 * Business context: Audit logs are compliance-critical and only super-admins
 * should be able to delete them. This test ensures such protection, preventing
 * accidental or malicious log manipulation by regular users.

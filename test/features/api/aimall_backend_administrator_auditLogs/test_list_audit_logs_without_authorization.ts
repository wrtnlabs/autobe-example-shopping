/**
 * Validate that non-admin users and unauthenticated requests are strictly
 * denied access to system audit logs.
 *
 * This function tests two critical security scenarios to prevent unauthorized
 * retrieval of sensitive audit logs:
 *
 * 1. Unauthenticated Access Attempt: Attempt to fetch audit logs using a
 *    connection without any authentication headers – should result in
 *    authentication error.
 * 2. Non-Admin User Attempt: Simulate a user session (non-admin), attempt to fetch
 *    audit logs – should result in an authorization error.
 *
 * These tests ensure compliance with security and compliance mandates, ensuring
 * that operational/system audit logs are accessible only to fully privileged
 * administrators and are not leaked through privilege escalation or
 * authentication bypass.
 *
 * Note: Only the unauthenticated access test is actually implemented because
 * user creation/login endpoints or non-admin privilege simulation APIs are not
 * provided in the material.

/**
 * Validate that a platform administrator can successfully hard-delete a channel
 * by UUID without dependent records.
 *
 * This test ensures that channel deletion operates as a true hard-delete (not
 * soft), and that the channel becomes fully irretrievable after removal.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Provision a new unique test channel via create API.
 * 2. Retrieve the created channel's details to assert successful creation.
 * 3. Delete the channel by its UUID using the hard-delete (erase) API.
 * 4. Attempt to retrieve channel detailsâ€”confirm error/absence, proving
 *    hard-delete success.
 *
 * Coverage:
 *
 * - Full lifecycle: create, lookup, delete, verify removal
 * - Uniqueness and absence of dependents are enforced by creation of a brand new
 *   entity with no links.
 * - Post-deletion, API attempts to find the deleted channel must fail (e.g.,
 *   throw or return not found).

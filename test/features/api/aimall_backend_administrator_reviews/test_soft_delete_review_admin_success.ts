/**
 * Validate that an administrator can soft-delete (erase) any product review in
 * the system, and that audit/compliance flows are correct.
 *
 * Business context:
 *
 * - Administrator should be able to erase any product review (regardless of
 *   reviewer/customer), for compliance and moderation purposes.
 * - Soft-deletion sets the 'deleted_at' field rather than removing the record, so
 *   it persists for audit purposes, but is hidden from normal product/customer
 *   review queries.
 *
 * Test process:
 *
 * 1. As a customer, create a new product review (capture `review.id`).
 * 2. As an administrator, erase (soft-delete) that review using the admin-only
 *    endpoint.
 * 3. (If feasible:) Assert `deleted_at` is set after deletion. (NOTE: Not
 *    verifiable due to lack of admin/query API.)
 * 4. (If feasible:) Assert review hidden from customer-facing review queries.
 *    (NOTE: Not implementable with exposed SDK.)
 *
 * Due to the limited API surface (create/erase only, no query/read for
 * reviews), only creation and deletion flows can be verified in code.
 * Query/result assertions cannot be implemented and are left as comments for
 * completeness.

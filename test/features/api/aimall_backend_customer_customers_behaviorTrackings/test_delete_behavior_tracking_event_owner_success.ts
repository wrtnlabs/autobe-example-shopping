/**
 * Test permanent deletion of a customer behavior tracking event by its owner.
 *
 * Verifies that a customer account can hard-delete a personal behavior tracking
 * record, as required for privacy (right-to-be-forgotten). This test simulates
 * a customer registration, event creation, and then record deletion, checking
 * that the operation completes and returns no body. If resource lookup were
 * possible, post-delete retrieval would be expected to fail.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Register a new customer (unique email/phone, status active)
 * 2. Create a behavior tracking event for that customer (e.g., "login")
 * 3. Hard-delete the just-created event as the customer (irreversible)
 * 4. (Optional, not implemented): Attempt to get the event after deletionâ€”expected
 *    not found. This is skipped as no GET endpoint is provided.

/**
 * ⚠️ Cannot implement test for creating a post with missing required fields due
 * to strict TypeScript type safety.
 *
 * This test scenario aims to validate failure when attempting to create a post
 * while omitting required fields such as 'title' or 'body'. However, such
 * scenarios are not implementable at the E2E test level in a TypeScript
 * environment using the provided SDK and DTOs, since TypeScript enforces
 * presence of all required fields at compile time.
 *
 * Per test framework guidelines, E2E tests should only check runtime business
 * logic errors with valid, properly typed code—not those that require violating
 * the TypeScript type system. Any attempt to do otherwise (e.g., via 'as any')
 * is disallowed.
 *
 * Therefore, this scenario is not implemented. Input validation for required
 * fields is enforced at the type level in the SDK and cannot be bypassed for
 * E2E tests.

/**
 * Simulate a customer soft deleting their own post (by setting the deleted_at
 * field).
 *
 * This test ensures that when a customer deletes their own community post via
 * the provided API, a soft deletion is performed (the record remains for audit
 * purposes, but is typically hidden from regular post queries). While the
 * systemâ€™s API currently does not expose a direct way to fetch or list posts
 * after deletion, this test ensures that the API call succeeds and the post is
 * logically removed (soft deleted) as per business rules.
 *
 * Step-by-step process:
 *
 * 1. Create a new post as a customer using the appropriate API endpoint.
 * 2. Soft delete that post by calling the delete endpoint.
 * 3. (Optionally) If a post retrieval endpoint existed, confirm deleted_at is set
 *    and post is unlisted, but absence of such endpoint means the test is
 *    limited to confirmation of successful flow and types.

/**
 * Validate that snapshot listing for a private post is access-controlled.
 *
 * This test ensures that when Customer A creates a private post and uploads a
 * snapshot, Customer B cannot view the post's snapshots, enforcing post privacy
 * and data security.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Customer A creates a private post.
 * 2. Customer A uploads a snapshot for the post.
 * 3. Customer B (simulated by reuse of connection, as authentication switching is
 *    not specified) attempts to GET the snapshots for Customer A's post â€” must
 *    receive permission denied or not found error.
 *
 * The test confirms that unauthorized customers are prevented from reading
 * private post attachments.

/**
 * Test successful soft deletion of a product review by its author.
 *
 * This test verifies the soft-delete business logic for product reviews in a
 * customer context:
 *
 * 1. Create a new review as the authenticated customer using the API.
 * 2. Assert proper review fields (deleted_at is null, fields match input).
 * 3. Soft-delete (erase) the review record by id.
 * 4. Attempt to erase a second time; expects error (or silent no-op) as per
 *    backend rule.
 * 5. (TODO) If/when API exposes a single-review fetch or index endpoint, would
 *    verify deleted_at set and review is hidden post-deletion.
 *
 * This flow ensures that only the reviewer can soft-delete their feedback, that
 * soft-deletion is handled as a timestamp, and that repeated deletion is
 * blocked or idempotent per system policy. The function makes all business
 * checks feasible with today's API surface.

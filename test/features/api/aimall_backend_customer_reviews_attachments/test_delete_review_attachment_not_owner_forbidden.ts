/**
 * Validate that a customer cannot delete another customer's review attachment.
 *
 * This test checks the system's security and access controls around review
 * attachments by simulating:
 *
 * 1. Customer A registers and creates a product review.
 * 2. Customer A attaches a file to their review.
 * 3. Customer B registers/logs in as a separate customer.
 * 4. Customer B attempts to delete the attachment from Customer A's review.
 * 5. System should reject the deletion with a forbidden error, and the attachment
 *    must remain.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Register/Log in Customer A (setup connection session).
 * 2. Customer A creates a review (keep reviewId).
 * 3. Customer A uploads an attachment for that review (keep attachmentId).
 * 4. Register/Log in Customer B (ensure session is replaced).
 * 5. Customer B attempts to delete Customer A's attachment (should be forbidden).
 * 6. Optionally, query for the attachment again (if list/read APIs exist), or
 *    simulate check by re-upload.
 *
 * This ensures attachment deletion API strictly enforces ownership
 * restrictions.

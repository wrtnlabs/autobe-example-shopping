/**
 * Runtime validation of missing required fields cannot be performed in strict
 * TypeScript E2E tests.
 *
 * This test scenario describes a customer attempting to create a support ticket
 * while omitting required fields such as 'subject' or 'body'. However, the
 * provided API SDK and DTO definitions render such negative test cases
 * impossible: TypeScript's strict type safety means attempting to omit required
 * fields results in compilation errors well before execution.
 *
 * Therefore, this scenario cannot be directly tested using the available E2E
 * framework, and this function serves as a documentation point only. In strict
 * E2E test suites, only runtime business logic errors that can be triggered
 * with valid DTO objects are testable. Any validation enforced by the
 * TypeScript type system must be covered by compile-time guarantees, not test
 * code.
 *
 * If runtime business logic errors can be triggered (e.g., via invalid enums,
 * domain errors), those should instead be tested here by constructing validly
 * typed but logically incorrect objects.

/**
 * Validate that a seller can remove an attachment from a review corresponding
 * to their product.
 *
 * This end-to-end test ensures that only a seller owning the product can delete
 * an attachment from a customer review of that product. It verifies the
 * business rule that deletion is only allowed by authorized parties (seller of
 * the associated product) and that the attachment is actually removed after
 * deletion.
 *
 * Test process:
 *
 * 1. (Setup) Seller registers and creates a product.
 * 2. (Setup) Customer posts a review targeting the above product.
 * 3. (Setup) Customer adds an attachment (media file) to the review.
 * 4. (Action) Seller, authenticated as owner of the product, deletes that review
 *    attachment.
 * 5. (Assert) Confirm that the attachment is no longer present in the reviewâ€™s
 *    attachments list after deletion, demonstrating both business authorization
 *    and effect.
 *
 * Note: Because there is no endpoint to authenticate or enumerate sellers or
 * customers and their tokens/roles in the given API materials, this test
 * assumes that API connection context switching is handled externally or by
 * higher order setup, and focuses on main resource creation/removal/observation
 * steps. If functions to fetch attachments list for a review existed, use them
 * for assertion; else, structure assertion as far as technically feasible.
